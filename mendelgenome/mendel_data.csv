A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in [http://www.lef.org/protocols/heart_circulatory/homocysteine_reduction_01.htm this] article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.$With regard to [[gastric cancer]], a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with [[rs1801133]] (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. $Another meta-analysis of three studies on [[rs1801133]] stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).$[[rs1801131]] and [[rs1801133]] have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain [[cancer]].

However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).$A study of 677 patients with [[end-stage renal disease]] (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for [[rs1801133]](T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.$In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men.

The GWAS employed used Alzheimer&#8217;s disease progression measured quantitatively from Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CRD-SB) scores over time. Additionally, the study utilized information about 200 Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients, 300 MCI patients, and 200 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. Significance was assessed based on the interaction term between genotype and time in a Cox proportional hazards model. rs12752888 was among two SNPs in the GWAS study to reach genome-wide significance in the Vitamin E MCL trial with a false-positive rate of 0.05 adjusting for 1 million SNPs (p < 8.31 &#215; 10^&#8722;9 ).

rs17602729,CC,0,Good,normal,"This position is odd. Under the older reference genome build36, it was on the plus strand; in build37 it is on the minus strand. This makes it very prone to some [[ambiguous flip]] confusion in the literature, plus, 23andMe users have self-reported the flipped form. IN addition, instead of the usual SNP listed as having 2 alleles, all 4 alleles are reported in dbSNP, even if this is probably due to the strand changes. dbSNP currently says the normal allele is C, and T is the rare geno which causes a premature stop, early in the gene. We at SNPedia suspect that the A & G alleles are not common enough to have ever been genuinely reported, but for de-novo mutations each allele would be non-synonymous and result in a different amino acid. http://snpedia.blogspot.com/2012/12/snpedias-nightmare-before-christmas.html$[[rs17602729]], a SNP located in the [[AMPD1]] gene and also known as 'C34T', has at times been called the most prevalent genetic disease mutation, at least in Caucasians.  Perhaps up to 10% of Caucasians and African-American carry one C34T allele (i.e. carry one rs17602729(A) allele) - and actually, most of them are unaware of any medically related issues since they don't typically have any particular symptoms that would warrant a trip to the doctor.$So what's the issue? The [[AMPD1]] gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is [[rs17602729(A;A)]], i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele. It is not known why only some of C34T homozygotes experience muscle myalgia.$Heterozygotes, i.e. [[rs17602729(A;G)]] individuals, do not seem to suffer any exercise or fitness related deficit. In fact, one of the best elite Caucasian distance runners is known to be a C34T heterozygote. $In fact, heterozygotes for [[rs17602729]] may even have advantages over those lacking a C34T allele. The most striking study reported that C34T heterozygotes are 8.6 fold (CI: 3.05 - 23.87) more likely to survive for more than 5 years without needing a heart transplant after a congestive heart failure related hospitalization than the wild-type homozygotes (i.e. [[rs17602729(G;G)]] homozygotes).  Similarly, C34T heterozygotes with [[coronary artery disease]] seem to fare better than wild-type homozygotes. $This is one of the SNPs reported by [[NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker]].",,1,115236057,AMPD1

[[rs1801274]](C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. $What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as [[rituximab]].$Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:$* [[HIV]] to [[AIDS]], including susceptibility and progression$** In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to [[AIDS]] was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness. $* [[Lymphoma]]$** A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of [[rs1801274]] were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006).$*[[Hemophilia A]]$**In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype$* [[Malaria]]$** Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, [[rs1801274]](T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the [[malaria]] non-endemic region. $* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)$** A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with [[rs1801274]](C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. $Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:$* Studies involving [[cetuximab]]:$** In a study of 39 patients with metastatic [[colorectal cancer]] treated with [[cetuximab]], the [[rs1801274]](T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months. $* Studies involving [[infliximab]]:$** A study of 91 patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] found that at week 30 of treatment with [[infliximab]], [[rs1801274]](C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035). $* Studies involving [[rituximab]]:$** In a study of 58 Croatian patients with [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]], [[rs1801274]] did not influence response, event-free or overall survival. $* Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:$** In a study of 136 patients with high risk [[neuroblastoma]] treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the [[rs1801274]](C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023). $[[Malaria Complications]]",,1,161479745,FCGR2A

The resulting [[rs6025]](A) allele encodes a mutation known as the Leiden mutation, R506Q. This mutation is often referred to as the G1691A or 1691G-A change.$See the [http://omim.org/entry/612309 OMIM entry]$In a 2017 study using UK Biobank, based on 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls, the odds ratio for a polymorphism involving the minor risk allele was 3.5. They also found higher odds for venous thromboembolism in overweight individuals (+1.57 for every 1 SD higher BMI).  $In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of Factor V [[rs6025]] variants was based on 9,081 cases and 17,513 controls. The polymorphic variant risk for [[Venous Thromboembolism]] was overall OR: 4.38. The risk was greater in younger subjects (<45 years old, OR: 5.43; ≥45 years old, OR: 3.71). Slightly higher risk appeared in men (OR: 5.06) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OR: 6.10). The AG polymorphic variant was associated with recurrent thrombosis (recurrent VTE event, OR: 5.81; no recurrence reported, OR: 3.95). The higher risks were for venous thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism (OR: 4.49) or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (OR: 4.14). The AA homozygous variant was rarer, and its risk was significantly higher at 11.45 but was based on fewer individuals (116 subjects among cases and 24 controls). Independent risk was seen in variants of the PT20210A or Factor 2 SNP at [[i3002432]] (also known as [[rs1799963]] ) $Other studies have come to similar conclusions. In a 2004 study of over 9,000 Caucasian adults in the Danish population, [[rs6025]](A;G) and [[rs6025]](A;A) genotypes had 2.7x and 18x higher risk for [[venous thromboembolism]], respectively, than [[rs6025]](G;G) individuals. The lowest absolute 10-year risks for [[venous thromboembolism]] for (A;G) and (A;A) genotypes were 0.7% (CI: 0.5% to 1.0%) and 3% (CI: 1% to 8%) for nonsmokers younger than 40 years of age with a body mass index below 25 kg/m2, and the corresponding highest risks were 10% (CI: 7% to 14%) and 51% (CI: 13% to 100%) for overweight smokers over 60.$In a study done in the year 2000 on 119 women, it was found that women who are pregnant and [[rs6025]](A) carriers could be at risk for obstetric complications, including [[pre-eclampsia]] or [[venous thromboembolism]], especially if they were also prothrombin [[rs1799963]] heterozygotes and/or have a family history of thrombosis. They concluded that if you assume an overall risk rate of 1 in 1500 pregnancies, the risk of thrombosis among [[rs6025]](A)  carriers by itself would be 0.2 percent (1 in 500); among carriers of the prothrombin [[rs1799963]](A) by itself, would be 0.5 percent (1 in 200); and among carriers of both variant SNPs, 4.6 percent (about 1 in 20).$A 2006 review article of 10 previous studies found that women who are [[rs6025]](A) carriers also are at increased risk for [[venous thromboembolism]] and perhaps ischemic stroke when they take combined oral contraceptives (i.e. the pill). A 2006 literature meta-analysis from a total of 10 studies concluded that good evidence existed for a greater risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] (risk ratios of 1.3-25.1) and cerebral vein or cerebral sinus thrombosis when comparing heterozygotes taking such contraceptives to heterozygotes who did not. $Additionally, a 2004 meta-analysis involving 18,000 cases and 58,000 controls found an increased risk for ischemic [[stroke]] for [[rs6025]](A) carriers. The odds ratio based on a study of ~4,500 patients was 1.33, CI: 1.12-1.58.$Although preliminary, a 2010 study found that women taking [[tamoxifen]] as part of their treatment for early-stage [[breast cancer]], those who had a thromboembolic event were nearly five times more likely to have a [[rs6025]](A) allele compared to those who did not have a TE. The authors suggest that postmenopausal women should be evaluated for the [[rs6025]](A) SNP before being given a prescription for [[tamoxifen]] if the result would affect the decision. $A related editorial pointed out that [[tamoxifen]] on its own is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events 2-4 fold.$According to a 1999 Blood journal article, coexistence of the R2 polymorphism [[rs1800595]] with factor V Leiden increased the risk for venous thrombosis approximately to a 16-fold increased risk.  The average age of the first thrombotic event is six years younger in individuals who are heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the R2 polymorphism than in those with factor V Leiden alone.

rs4606,CC,,,complex; possible association with anxiety related behaviours,"In mice, the genetic locus best correlated to anxiety-related behaviour contains the 'regulator of G protein signaling 2' gene . In humans, SNPs in the equivalent [[RGS2]] gene have now been studied to see if they are correlated to [[anxiety]] related disorders.$In the first part of one study, 119 families including children underwent standard lab-based behavioural assessments of behavioural inhibition, defined as a heritable temperamental profile characterized by a tendency to be shy, avoident, and behaviourally restrained in situations that are novel or unfamiliar. Along with some other [[RGS2]] SNPs, carriers of a [[rs4606]](G) allele were 3 fold more likely to exhibit behavioural inhibition (CI: 1.31-6.84, p = 0.0026).$In the second part of this study, 744 college undergraduates (228 men, 516 women) who had been genotyped completed a [[personality]] profile known as the NEO-E (introversion) association test. Consistent with the earlier results, the same [[RGS2]] alleles associated with behavioural inhibition were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with introversion (but not neuroticism), including [[rs4606]](G), [[rs6428136]](G), and [[rs10801152]](T).$In the third part of this study, 55 female undergraduates were studied by fMRI (functional MRI) emotional processing tests. Carriers of SNPs [[rs4606]](G) or [[rs10801152]](T) showed increased insular cortex activation, a reflection of anxiety, in these tests.$Based on these results, the authors predict that [[social anxiety disorder]] is the most likely anxiety disorder to be associated with SNPs in the [[RGS2]] gene such as [[rs4606]]. $ $ SNPs in the [[RGS2]] gene, including [[rs4606]], show association with childhood temperament, adult personality, and brain function.$ each [[rs4606]](C) allele was associated with a 2x (p =.026) increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder.$ 173 patients with panic disorder (and 173 matched controls) of German descent analyzed, leading to the conclusion that [[rs4606]](G) carriers were at ~2x increased risk for this disorder. Note that the (G) allele appears to be the minor (rarer) allele in this study.$'''Note:''' given the conflicting reports over whether the (C) or (G) allele is implicated in anxiety-related disorders, Dr. Jordan Smoller was contacted to verify that the orientation was unambiguously reported in the various publications. He has confirmed that the reports truly vary in which allele is considered the risk allele; this may be an example of the flip-flop phenomenon .$[[rs4606]] has also been reported to be associated with the development of Parkinson's like symptoms in [[schizophrenia]] patients treated with various drugs, as follows:$ A replication study was performed in which extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were rated in 184 US patients with [[schizophrenia]]. This group (115 African Americans, 69 Caucasian) was treated for at least a month with typical antipsychotic drugs (n=45), [[risperidone]] (n=46), [[olanzapine]] (n=50) or [[clozapine]] (n=43). The minor (G) allele showed a protective effect against antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP), with an odds ratio for AIP among [[rs4606]](G) carriers of 0.23 (CI: 0.10-0.54, p=0.001) for the overall sample.$[http://genes2brains2mentalhealth.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/from-the-insula-rs4606-pulls-a-common-thread-back-through-developmental-space-and-time/ blog] discussion$ 121 consecutively hospitalized, psychotic patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV [[schizophrenia]] receiving treatment with typical antipsychotic medication (n=72) or typical antipsychotic drugs and [[risperidone]] (n=49) for at least 2 weeks were studied.

These alleles contributed to an absolute lowering of the risk of all LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) by 4.88 and 14.93 % when individuals do not carry these alleles. Researchers stated that LADA accounts for 2–12 % of all cases of diabetes but The progression to insulin dependence in LADA patients is believed more rapidly than classic type 2 diabetes patients and 8–10 % of patients diagnosed with T2D are in fact misdiagnosed LADA. $ A 2015 study titled Association between CTLA-4 [[rs231775]] polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility revealed that The frequencies of genotype AA and allele A in CTLA-4 [[rs231775]] polymorphism were significantly higher in cases of [[liver cancer]] than the control group (AA vs. GG: OR=2.81, P=0.043; A vs. G: OR=1.63, P=0.022).

The minor G allele decreased cancer risk overall and for a large number of cancer types, especially for breast cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers, epithelial tumor, respiratory system cancer, reproductive and breast cancer, malignant bone tumor, but not digestive system cancer, hematopoietic malignancy and skin cancer. Most of the decreased cancer risk was in Asian populations. Table 3 data demonstrated association between the risk of cancer and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism (GG+AG vs. AA). Although most of the Asian data showed decreased risk, a few studies showed extreme increased risk, and these data skewed the average OD. On average, the data showed 0.85 OD of decreased cancer risk overall (0.98 for Caucasians and 0.76 for Asians).$ In this 2008 article, researchers reported that One of the best demonstrations of the power of subset analysis is the CTLA-4 gene in T1D. Although CTLA-4 showed very weak association with T1D, when analyzed in the subset of patients with both T1D and AITD, the genetic effect of CTLA-4 was significantly stronger.

rs53576,AG,2.8,Bad,Lack of empathy?,"rs53576 is a silent G to A change in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with the G allele are more empathetic, feel less lonely, employ more sensitive parenting techniques, and have lower rates of autism (discussed in )$The blog [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/08/16/genes-and-culture-oxtr-gene-influences-social-behaviour-differently-in-americans-and-koreans/ Not Exactly Rocket Science] discusses that Americans with (G;G) tend to be more sensitive parents, more empathetic and less lonely than those with an &#8216;A&#8217;. In a Korean population people with (G;G) were less likely to seek support from their peers. $ Culture, distress, and oxytocin receptor polymorphism (OXTR) interact to influence emotional support seeking.$ Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans. In brief, people with the G;G genotype were better able to discern the emotional state of others than those who carried the A-allele ([http://genes2brains2mind2me.com/2009/11/24/look-deeply-into-my-eyes-and-let-me-see-your-genes/ blog] summary found here).  The study encompassed 192 participants of both sexes and mixed ethnicities. The study subjects underwent a number of tests to determine their level of empathy and stress reactivity. They found that G;G individuals performed significantly better on the behavioral measure of empathy and were 22.7% less likely to make a mistake on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) (a behavioural measure of empathic accuracy) than A;A/A;G individuals (P = 0.005). Similarly, G;G individuals reported higher levels of dispositional empathy than A;A/A;G individuals: mean (SE) = 3.69 (0.06) and 3.53 (0.04) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively (P = 0.025), and were less affected by stress (as measured by their heart rates): mean (SE) = 72.1 (0.54) and 78.4 (1.19) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively.$ Associations between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and affect, loneliness and intelligence in normal subjects.$ This study examined the association between the OXTR gene and parenting. A total of 176 mothers of toddlers were included in the study. After controlling for marital discord, depression, and education status, rs53576 was found to significantly correlate with parenting, with the G;G genotype being associated with a significantly more sensitive parenting style than A;A or A;G genotypes. However, they concluded that the major factor influencing parenting was the maternal education level.$ Forty-five female subjects (17 twin pairs and 11 twins without their sibling) were genotyped and tested for their ability to hear and understand conversations in noisy environments. Participants with the G;G genotype reported less difficulty hearing and understanding (difficulty hearing total score [Mean (SD)], 9.2 (4.2)) than participants with A;A/A;G genotypes (13.9 (3.8); p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for age, the relationship between genotype and difficulty hearing scores was still significant (p = 0.003).$ Two hundred three healthy German male university students (mean age 23.2 y, SD 2.9 y) were subjected to a mock interview and their saliva cortisol levels were tested before and at a number of time points after the interview. Half of the participants were told to bring a female friend as social support, whereas the other half came alone to the interview. The authors found that subjects carrying the G allele (G;G or A;G genotypes) had significantly lower cortisol responses to stress when they had social support (P < 0.01). Conversely, there were no differences in cortisol levels in subjects with the A;A genotype receiving or not receiving social support (P = 0.46). Moreover, there was a trend (P = 0.08) for people with the A;A genotype to display higher levels of cortisol throughout the session than G carriers (no differences between the genotypes were observed at baseline).$[http://blog.23andme.com/2011/12/12/snpwatch-we-care-a-lot/ 23andMe blog] discusses the snp.$[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/2011/12/19/when-is-comfort-most-comforting-when-youve-got-a-specific-oxytocin-gene/ blogs.scientificamerican] discusses the snp.$ In this study, 345 healthy subjects were examined by multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify structural and functional alterations in OXTR risk allele carriers and their link to temperament. The authors found that there was a significant association between the different rs53576 genotypes and grey matter volume in the hypothalamus, with the hypothalamus volume being significantly larger in G;G carriers than in A;A carriers (P = 0.012). Moreover, they investigated the relationship between rs53576 and reward dependence (RD) using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and found that the G;G, G;A, and A;A genotypes were associated with the highest, intermediate, and lowest RD values, respectively (G;G vs. A;A, p=0.02; A;G vs. A;A, p=0.07). Lastly, they also demonstrated that rs53576 is associated with amygdala activation, with the A;A genotype being associated with a significant reduction in activation compared to the G;G genotype (p=0.036); and with the functional relationship between the amygdala and the hypothalamus, with A;A carrier having a significantly increased functional correlation (p=0.036). The authors concluded that there is likely a neural mechanism linking both structural and neural signalling alterations in the oxytocinergic system to individual differences in emotional reactivity and prosocial temperament.$ This study found that there is no association between rs53576 variants and the risk of autism in Caucasian children and adolescents.$Followup:","You have a SNP in the oxytocin receptor which may make you less empathetic than other people.  When under stress you may have more difficulty recognizing the emotional state of others which impacts loneliness, parenting, and socializing skills.$Some studies have suggested that the A;G genotype is associated with an intermediate level of empathy (compared to the G;G and A;A genotypes), although most report that A;G and A;A individuals have similar levels of empathy and stress handling capabilities.",3,8804371,OXTR

This single base substitution yields the atypical version of BChE.  This version has a lower affinity for many substrates, including many [[Cholinesterase Inhibitors]] (CIs).  A different cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) is an important component of neurotransmission by acetylcholine (ACh), terminating the action of ACh after it has been released during neurotransmission. BChE is found widely in the plasma and normally binds to CIs, protecting AChE from being inhibited by CIs and so maintaining normal neurotransmission by acetylcholine.$Practical consequences of altered substrate affinity from this SNP include:$* Succinylcholine, commonly used as an anesthetic, depends on BChE hydrolysis for recovery.  [[rs1799807]](G;G) homozygotes experience a much delayed return to spontaneous breathing following its use.  $* Atypical BChE has a low affinity for CI alkaloids naturally occuring in certain plants, particularly those in the nightshade family (potato, tomato, peppers, eggplant, etc.).  [[rs1799807]](G) carriers may be more prone to physiological consequences of AChE inhibition from eating these foods.$* Many pesticides are CIs, including organophosphates and carbamates.  [[rs1799807]](G) carriers may have atypical reactions to pesticide residues on foods and in the environment.$* Many nerve agents, such as Sarin and VX gas, as well agents used to protect soldiers against them, such as pyridostigmine, are CIs.  [[rs1799807]](G) carriers may be more susceptible to exposure to these agents.$  Atypical BuChE, [[rs1799807]](G), has 30% lower enzymatic activity than the wild-type enzyme.

rs2736990,CC,2,Bad,Slightly increased risk of developing Parkinson's Disease,"[[rs2736990]] is a SNP associated with [[Parkinson&#8217;s disease]] (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degradation of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.  Rs273990 is located on chromosome 4q22 in the synuclein-alpha [[SNCA]] locus. The function of SNCA is not fully understood, but it predominately found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, and it is thought that it plays a role in maintaining adequate supplies of synaptic vesicles.  SNCA is also a major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), protein accumulations often found in neurons in patients with PD.$The best evidence for the association of rs2736990 with PD was provided in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that found an increased frequency of the minor C allele (T is the major allele) in position 90897564 among cases compared to controls.   The study first identified this SNP in a pool of 1,713 cases and 3,978 controls of European ancestry.  The researchers then successfully replicated this significant finding in a separate group of 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, also of European ancestry.   Estimates of effect size and statistical significance from the pooled dataset (which incorporates both groups) are as follows: OR = 1.23, p = 2.24 x 10-17 .   $Several other studies have also examined the relationship between rs2736990 and PD. A group of Japanese researchers conducting a GWAS on 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls of Japanese descent found a significant association of rs2736990 with PD that survived Bonferroni correction (p-value not reported) .  Another group looked at only the rs2736990 SNP in 515 cases and 450 controls of Chinese descent and found the minor C allele was significantly more frequent in patients with PD (OR=1.26, p = 0.017).  Other studies have validated the association between rs2736990 and PD in European populations:  The Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center tested rs2736990 only in 344 cases and 275 controls and found a significant association (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0032); another group combined data from previous GWAS studies with their own data to create a GWAS dataset of 1752 cases and 1745 controls that yielded a significant association (OR = 1.29, p = 6.7 x 10-8) ; finally, a GWAS conducted on 772 cases and 2024 controls of Dutch descent found a significant association between rs2736990 and PD (OR = 1.325, p = 1.63 x 10-5). $It is not known with certainty how mutations in synuclein-alpha contribute to PD; however, mutations in this gene, both missense and copy number variants, have been linked to the development of PD. In addition, rs2736990 is one of several SNP&#8217;s in the SNCA locus significantly associated with PD in GWAS studies, and the significant association of this SNP with PD has been replicated and validated in several subsequent studies.  Moreover, estimates of effect size are similar across studies.  As such, the biological plausibility of this mutation appears high.  One candidate mechanism for development of PD due to SNCA hypothesizes that misfolded or excessively produced synuclein-alpha proteins accumulate in the neuron and interfere with normal function until they eventually cause death. This theory is supported by the abundance of synuclein-alpha proteins in LB&#8217;s found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

rs6817105,TT,0,Good,common/normal,"'''Atrial Fibrillation (rs6817105)$'''$The rs6817105 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is 150 kb upstream of the PITX2 gene and has been strongly associated with hereditary risk of atrial fibrillation.  Atrial fibrillation is an irregularity of heart rate resulting in, shortness of breath, heart rate palpations and poor blood flow, which results in strokes, heart failure and death (PMID:16908781). The irregularity is a result of the hearts upper chambers (atria) beating at an irregular pace compared to the lower two chambers (ventricles) of the heart (Mayo clinic). Atrial fibrillation is a major public health concern as risk increases with age, particularly after the age of 60. According to the CDC, Atrial fibrillation affects one in every 10 individuals over the age of 80. Atrial fibrillation is predicted to affect 6-12 million people in the USA by 2050 and 17.9 million in Europe by 2060 (PMID:25960110). However the causal mutation that increases risk of atrial fibrillation has not been fully elucidated.  $A potential candidate causal mutation associated with atrial fibrillation is PITX2, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2, a bicoid-related homeodomain transcription factor that is located in the 4q25 locus and plays important roles in embryonic development (OMIM). The PITX2 gene is important in developing the left–right symmetry of the heart. PITX2 loss of function mutations in mice resulted in severe defects in heart.  (PMID:12732450)$Additionally PITX2 was found to be associated with atrial fibrillation in a meta-analysis of multiple well phenotyped GWAS studies of atrial fibrillation in 2015 by Ellinor et al. The study involved six cohorts of patients from European ancestry to identify genetic variants that are associated with heritability and risk of atrial fibrillation. Genomic sequence analysis included 6,707 patients with Atrial fibrillation and 52,426 patients without atrial fibrillation. The study identified 10 loci that exceeded the studies threshold for genome-wide significance (P-value < 5 x 10-8). The study identified three previously known genes. The most significantly associated loci was at previously identified atrial fibrillation susceptibility loci on chromosomes 4q25 near PITX2 (rs6817105; P = 1.8 × 10−74 ; odds ratio = 1.64). The rs6817105 SNP has a minor allele of C and major allele of T with Minor allele frequency being 13.1%. Replicate studies of six newly identified Atrial fibrillation loci were done in additional patients European ancestry, 5,381 with and 10,030 patients without Atrial fibrillation. Four of the six loci identified in Europeans were replicated in silico in GWAS of patients of Japanese ancestry, 843 patients with and 3,350 patients without Atrial Fibrillation The six novel susceptibility loci in or near plausible genes associated with atrial fibrillation are implicated in the regulation of the heart development through transcription factors, ion channel and cell signaling molecules, which may help explain the heritability of atrial fibrillation. However, further biological studies are warranted to verify the newly identified loci associated with atrial fibrillation.  (PMID:22544366)",,4,111705768,
rs10034228,TT,,,,"[[rs10034228]] is a SNP that has been associated with pathological myopia (nearsightedness) in Han Chinese. Pathological myopia refers to an error in refractive index greater than -6.0 diopters (D), and it may be associated with degeneration in the back of the eye . This SNP is a C/T variant in an intergenic region of chromosome 4q25. The ancestral allele is T. Two reports to date have identified the significance of this association. $The first report  conducted a GWAS in three stages on a total of 2,993 cases and 10,406 controls from Zhejiang Province and Shanghai, both in China. The first stage examined older patients with severe myopia (mean refraction < -8.00 D) suffering from retinal degeneration, the second stage examined adolescents with milder myopia (mean refraction = -6.70 D &#177; 1.61), and the third stage examined a broader population (mean refraction = -12.21 D &#177; 4.89). Meta-analysis of these results identified that rs10034228(T) is protective from myopia (p = 7.70 x 10-8, OR = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.76&#8211;0.86), and that rs10034228(C) is associated with myopia. They also observed that the SNP is within the MYP11 locus, a locus for autosomal dominant high myopia identified in a Chinese family [PMID: 16052171]. There are no known genes in the region, although there are expressed sequence tags, a predicted gene, and enhancers. Nominal associations for rs2218817 (p = 4.16 &#215; 10-25), rs4440293 (p = 5.49 &#215; 10-25), rs1585471 (p = 2.14 &#215; 10-26), and rs6837348 (p = 3.21 &#215; 10-26) were also discovered. $Interestingly, SNPs significantly associated with myopia identified in previous GWA studies in different populations (rs577948 in Japanese samples , rs634990 in Caucasian samples , and rs8027411 ) were not significant in this first report, a finding that the authors attributed to genetic heterogeneity between ethnicities, differences in clinical criteria for myopic cases, and complexity of the trait.$The results of the first report were subsequently validated in a case-control study of university students in Guangzhou, China . In this study, there were 1052 controls (mean refraction = -0.5 D to +2.00 D), 615 moderate myopia cases (-4.00 D to -6.00 D), and 640 high myopia cases (mean refraction = &#8804; -6.00 D). Notably, these cases of myopia were less severe than in the aforementioned GWAS. The study validated five SNPs in 4q25 associated with high myopia in Chinese adults from the previous study: rs2218817 (p = 0.009, OR = 1.18), rs1585471 (p = 0.007, OR = 1.19), rs6837348 (p = 0.012, OR = 1.18), and rs10034228 (p = 0.009, OR = 1.18). There was no significant difference found between the moderate myopia group and high myopia group.$A GWAS meta-analysis of 2793 cases and 4643 controls from various cities in China, also investigating myopia, found three additional SNPs associated with myopia (rs2597881, rs326896 and rs12508492) and found that the these SNPs are in the same LD block of the HapMap HCB (Han Chinese in Beijing) database as rs10034228 and other myopia-associated SNPs . This finding further corroborates the association of rs10034228 with myopia. Notably, in this study, the patients had more severe myopia (mean refractive index OD (right eye) = -11.21 D &#177; 3.92, mean refractive index OS (left eye) = 10.74 D &#177; 3.65).}}$[[Nearsightedness and Farsightedness]]",,4,112611750,

rs37369,CC,0,Good,common in clinvar,"'''rs37369''' is a [[SNP]] located in the coding region of the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 ([[AGXT2]]) gene within chromosome 5 at position 35,072,872. This polymorphism constitues a nonsynonymous valine-to-isoleucine (V140I) substitution in the AGXT2 protein. rs37369 has been proposed by one study to be the causative SNP of [[hyper-beta-aminoisobutyric aciduria]]. $Beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) is the end product of pyrimidine metabolism. Hyper-BAIB is an autosomal recessive phenotype that is distinguished by high urinary excretion levels of beta-aminoisobutyric acid . Elevated levels of BAIB have been suggested to contribute to neurological and developmental problems, as BAIB is a structural analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine--two major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system . The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database states that hyper-beta-aminoisobutyric aciduria is likely the most common Mendelian metabolic variant in man [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/210100].$In a 2011 study, rs37369 was found to have a strong association with hyper-beta-aminoisobutyric aciduria . In this study, 59 urine metabolite concentrations and 1,661 ratios between metabolite concentrations were tested for associations in 645,249 autosomal SNPs in 862 male German individuals. After correcting for multiple testing, rs37369 was found to have a significant association (p-value = 3.17 x 10^-75). The study further confirmed this result by replicating it twice more with 992 German samples of both sexes, and 870 German female samples. Resulting in p-values of 3.3 x 10^-52 and 1.3 x 10^-56, respectively. In all, these three independent replicates had a joint p-value of 2.1 x 10^-182.$The AGXT2 gene, where the coding rs37369 SNP resides, encodes a mitochondrial aminotransferase expressed primarily in the kidney that catalyzes the reactions of BAIB with pyruvate to form 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate ([http://expasy.org/enzyme/2.6.1.40]) and alanine. High excretion of BAIB is thought to result from an impairment in BAIB catabolism due to a deficiency in the activity of the AGXT2 enzyme. The association of rs37369 with BAIB matches the enzymatic function of AGXT2. Given the strength of the association (2.1 x 10^-182), and the fact that rs37369 codes for a nonsynonymous substitution (V140I), it has been posed as the causal SNP of hyper-beta-aminoisobutyric aciduria, although this hypothesis has not yet been experimentally verified .",,5,35037115,AGXT2

rs2076295,GT,1.2,Bad,"One copy of the risk allele (G), slightly increased risk for pulmonary fibrosis","The SNP '''rs2076295''' on chromosome 6p24 is located within the intronic region of the DSP gene, which encodes the protein desmoplakin. Desmoplakin is a component of the desmosome, and is an adhesive intercellular molecule that tightly links adjacent cells for cell-cell adhesion. It is part of a dynamic structure that involves other proteins, such as plakoglobin and plakophilins, which tether the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . The minor allele [[rs2076295]](G) is reported by dbSNP to have an allele frequency (MAF) of 0.454.$A recent case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,616 cases and 4,683 controls (and a replication study with 876 cases and 1,890 controls) was performed on non- Hispanic white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) ; note the correction posted online 1 Oct 2013. The most common and severe form of IIP is idiopathic [[pulmonary fibrosis]] (IFP), and all forms of IIP (including IFP) were included in this study, in which a total of 439,828 SNPs were studied. Using an additive model for the minor allele at each SNP, a total of 19 SNPs, representing 7 chromosome locations, with genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) were identified in the GWAS discovery process.$Apart from SNPs that have been previously associated with IIP in the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes , many of the other genome-wide significant SNPs reported in this study were newly discovered risk loci for IIP. Among them is '''rs2076295''' (minor allele = G; P<sub>meta</sub> = 1.1 x 10<sup>-19</sup>), which is in the intronic region of the DSP gene, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 for IIP (discovery GWAS). A related lung tissue gene expression study (100 IPF cases, 94 controls) showed that DSP expression was down-regulated in cases when compared to controls (P = 0.0002), and the expression level was genotype-dependent on the SNP (P = 0.002) &#8211; relative expression of DSP decreased with the number of copies of the putative risk allele, with GG alleles having the lowest level of expression, and TT the highest. This is consistent with the additive model used in the discovery GWAS.$IIP represents a group of lung diseases that are often characterized by [[pulmonary fibrosis]] or progressive scarring of the alveolar interstitium, which can eventually lead to hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency and death . Some forms are known to be associated with environmental exposures (e.g. asbestos), drug toxicity, radiation exposure, or collagen vascular diseases (e.g. scleroderma). Previous studies have focused on the association between IIP and the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes. MUC5B encodes mucin 5B, expressed in mucus-producing cells in the distal airways of the lung. Lung tissue from individuals with IIP has higher concentrations of MUC5B than controls. TERT and TERC are involved in the maintenance of telomere lengths, and mutations in these genes are associated with shortened telomeres in the alveolar epithelia.$The recently discovered association with the DSP locus suggests that changes in cell-cell adhesion may also play a role in IIP. Desmosomes (and desmoplakin) are important in maintaining the integrity of tissues that experience mechanical stress (such as the peripheral portions of the lung), and there is strong evidence that perturbation of the desmosome disrupts epithelial homeostasis . Mutations in DSP have also been associated with other diseases that involve loss of tissue integrity, such as in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia , keratodermas , and alopecia .",,6,7563232,DSP

rs1799945,CC,0,Good,Not a H63D hemochromatosis carrier.,"[[rs1799945]], also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary [[hemochromatosis]] (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body&#8217;s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 . In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations . A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.$==HFE Gene==$The HFE gene encodes the human hemochromatosis protein, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. The protein regulates iron absorption by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin. The HFE protein interacts with TFRC, the transferrin receptor protein 1, so its primary mode of action is through regulation of the iron storage hormone [[hepcidin]].$====Mutations in the HFE Gene====$The three most common HH-causing mutations in the HFE gene (chromosome 6p21.3) are C282Y (A at [[rs1800562]] instead of G), H63D (G at [[rs1799945]] instead of C), and S65C (T at [[i3002468]] instead of A). At least 17 other mutations in the HFE gene have been linked to HH. 60-90% of people with HH have two copies of the C282Y mutation. The H63D mutation is also quite common&#8212;about 20% of people carry a copy of the mutation, and about 3% have two copies. This mutation is not as severe as the C282Y mutation, and only causes symptoms when someone has both the H63D and the C282Y mutations. Even then, only a small fraction of people with one copy of each mutation actually exhibit evidence of iron overload. Additionally, those who have two copies of H63D do not exhibit any symptoms and are not at risk for iron overload. The S65C mutation is less common, and will also only cause symptoms if in combination with C282Y. For both H63D/C282Y and S65C/C282Y single mutation individuals, symptoms are usually mild if they develop at all.$==Influence on Iron Levels==$HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms : the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.$==Symptoms of Hereditary Hemochromatosis==$The symptoms of HH depend on the person&#8217;s mutation as well as their sex and diet. The older a person, the more likely iron has accumulated in the body over time. Typically, complications may develop later in life between the ages of 40 and 60 in men and in post-menopausal women. If symptoms do develop, these are typically seen in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. At first, one may feel symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Later symptoms may lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, liver failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis.$====Symptomatic Findings in Patients with HH====$*Liver- hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver failure$*Joints- arthritis, swelling, [[chondrocalcinosis]]$*Heart- dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF$*Skin- increased pigmentation$*Endocrine- testicular atrophy, hypogonadism$*[[Hypothyroidism]]",,6,26091179,LOC108783645
rs1800562,GG,0,Good,Not a C282Y hemochromatosis carrier.,"[[rs1800562]] represents a SNP that accounts for ~85% of all cases of [[hemochromatosis]], a disorder whose symptoms include cirrhosis of the liver, [[diabetes]], hypermelanotic pigmentation of the skin, and heart failure. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=235200 OMIM] indicates that [[liver cancer]] is responsible for about one-third of deaths of [[rs1800562]](A;A) homozygotes, and since hemochromatosis is a relatively easily treated disorder if diagnosed, this is a form of preventable [[cancer]].$The [[rs1800562]](A) allele is known as the C282Y or Cys282Tyr mutation, and it is found at a frequency of around 5-10% in many Caucasian populations, leading to an incidence of (A;A) homozygotes around 1 in 200. Early identification of [[rs1800562]](A;A) homozygotes can prevent complications of [[hemochromatosis]]; however, the percentage of all (A;A) homozygotes who actually develop clinical signs of [[hemochromatosis]] may be relatively low, may depend on sex (see below), and appears to be influenced by other SNPs yet to all be discovered as well as (unidentified) environmental factors, possibly including the amount of iron in the diet.$In [[rs1800562]](A;A) patients who do develop [[hemochromatosis]], a SNP has been identified which increases the risk of cardiomyopathy (a form of [[heart disease]]). [[rs4880]](T;T) homozygotes are at ~10 fold increased risk for dilated- or non-dilated cardiopathy based on a study of 217 patients.$[[rs235756]], a SNP in the [[BMP2]] gene, is another SNP that may influence the development of [[hemochromatosis]] in [[rs1800562]](A;A) individuals, at least if serum transferrin levels are a good indication. Transferrin levels increased with increasing copies of the [[rs235756]](T) allele.  $So what percent of [[rs1800562]](A;A) individuals actually develop clinical signs of [[hemochromatosis]]? At least in the UK (Caucasian) population, a 2019 survey reported that of 2890 participants homozygous for p.C282Y (0.6%, or 1 in 156), hemochromatosis was diagnosed in 21.7% of men and 9.8% of women over an average follow up (~7 years). p.C282Y homozygous men aged 40 to 70 had a higher prevalence of diagnosed hemochromatosis (OR 411.1, CI: 299-565, p<0.001), liver disease (4.30, 2.97-6.18, p<0.001), rheumatoid arthritis (2.23, 1.51-3.31, p<0.001), osteoarthritis (2.01, 1.71-2.36, p<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (1.53, 1.16-1.98, p=0.002), versus 175,000+ controls (people with no p.C282Y mutations). During the seven year follow-up, 15.7% of homozygous men developed at least one incident associated condition versus 5.0% (p<0.001) with no p.C282Y mutations; for women, it was 10.1% vs 3.4%, p<0.001).$Women who are [[rs1800562]](A) homozygotes are less affected by [[hemochromatosis]] due to elimination of excess iron during menstruation, but may become affected after menopause.$Carriers of one [[rs1800562]](A) may be affected by a mild form of [[hemochromatosis]] if also a carrier of [[rs1799945]](G) H63D.$According to [https://cpmc.coriell.org/Sections/Results/rs1800562.aspx?PgId=184 Coriell], in Caucasian populations:$*(A;A) - 0.4% of individuals, carrying 2 copies of the risk variant (33-57% of such males will have quite elevated iron levels; 3-16% if female)$*(G;A) - 12% carry 1 copy of the risk variant and 1 copy of the non-risk variant$*(G;G) - 87.6% carry (only) the non-risk variant$ Was the C282Y mutation an Irish Gaelic mutation that the Vikings helped disseminate?

rs6932590,CT,1,Bad, 1.1x increased risk for schizophrenia,"[[rs6932590]] is a SNP that is postulated to have a role in conferring increased susceptibility for [[schizophrenia]].  [[rs6932590]] lies in the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) region on chromosome 6, a region that codes for several genes with significant roles in autoimmunity, such as human leukocyte antigens.  Specifically, [[rs6932590]] lies in an intergenic region between [[PRSS16]] (a serine protease expressed in the thymus that plays a role in positive T cell selection) and [[POM121L2]] (a membrane glycoprotein)  .$The T allele at [[rs6932590]] purportedly confers an increased risk for schizophrenia, with reported odds ratios of 1.16   and 1.31 .$=== Evidence ===$One large-scale case-controlled genome-wide association study (GWAS) that examined differential genotypes in individuals with schizophrenia, found five significant schizophrenia-associated SNP markers in the MHC region: [[rs6913660]], [[rs13219354]], [[rs6932590]], [[rs13211507]], and [[rs3131296]], with significant linkage disequilibrium between them.  This GWAS was performed by the International Schizophrenia Consortium (ISC), Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS), and SGENE and included, in all, 12,945 cases and 34,591 controls.  Samples were taken from Caucasian populations across Europe (eight separate geographical locations)   [http://blog.23andme.com/2009/07/03/snpwatch-researchers-show-importance-of-common-dna-variants-in-schizophrenia/ 23andMe blog].  [[rs6932590]] was found to be the most significant SNP between cases and controls, with a p-value of 1.4x10e-12.  The T allele was found to confer increased risk for schizophrenia with an odds ratio of 1.16.$In a separate GWAS that was designed to examine only the top eight significant SNPs (i.e., candidates) reported by the previous ISC/SGENE/MGS study , 2,496 cases and 5,184 control subjects from the Shanghai, China, population were genotyped.  [[rs6932590]] was again found to be significant (corrected p-value of 0.00096), as well as other SNPs in the MHC region ([[rs3131296]], [[rs3130375]]) .  The 0.00096 p-value is much higher than the one reported by the aforementioned ISC/SGENE/MGS study, however, the investigators deemed it significant.  This study also found the T allele at [[rs6932590]] to confer an increased risk for schizophrenia, but with an odds ratio of 1.31.  Overall, this study found only four of the eight candidate SNPs from the ISC/SGENE/MGS study to be significant (i.e., validated) in the genotyped Shanghai, China sample.$Importantly, in both of the above studies, [[rs2958182]], a SNP that lies in the [[TCF4]] gene (outside of the MHC region), was also found to be significant.  TCF4 codes for a transcription factor that is primarily expressed in pre-B cells and potentially plays a role in cognitive development .$A recent expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study investigated whether the SNPs reported by ISC/MGS/SGENE affect gene expression in normal human cortical brain tissue. The study did not find that [[rs6932590]] was associated with any significant differential expression .  However, the investigators noted that MHC region SNPs such as [[rs6932590]] may affect gene expression earlier in development, which is difficult to observe temporally, particularly in the elderly, post-mortem brain samples that were used in the eQTL study.$=== Biological Explanation ===$It is still unclear what role immune system genes may have on schizophrenia etiology, or whether the significant genes in the MHC region are even immune genes (there are other, non-immunity genes in the MHC region).  One interesting finding is that a single allele variant in a schizophrenia SNP marker in the MHC region, [[rs3131296]] (which has an r^2 of .86 with the [[HLA-DRB1]]*03 gene), while conferring risk for schizophrenia, confers increased protection for [[type-1 diabetes]], [[celiac disease]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] .$There have been hypotheses that a winter or spring season of birth (i.e., an implicit increased risk of maternal influenza infection during pregnancy; which could lead to inflammation and aberrant neuronal development/growth) or early childhood infections (e.g., measles) may catalyze the development of schizophrenia.  However, these hypotheses remain unproven and there was no evidence for them in the ISC/SGENE/MGS patient history data.$=== Competing/Complementary Theories ===$The polygenic inheritance model of schizophrenia is predicated on the idea that dozens of common variants combine to increase an individual's risk of schizophrenia.  However, there has been limited success in finding significant common SNPs that are associated with schizophrenia.  For example, in a study consisting of 1,870 schizophrenia cases and 2,002 controls that were genotyped for 789 SNPs that were hand-picked for their purported significance in schizophrenia susceptibility, no statistically significant associations were found .  At present, the most optimistic estimates of the magnitude of the effect of the polygenic model on disease susceptibility variance is approximately 20% .$  		$The most promising explanation of schizophrenia heritability may come from the significantly increased presence of rare structural variants such as deletions and duplications in individuals with schizophrenia .  Certainly, it is possible that certain SNPs, say in brain development or the immune system, may operate in concert with the effects of rare structural variants.  $Other theories to explain the missing heritability include effects from certain copy number variations ([[CNV]])   and effects from a few of many highly impactful, independent, rare alleles .$As of May 2011, the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium is working on the largest GWAS for schizophrenia ever performed, with 59,000 cases and 7,700 family trios .$=== References ===$ Common variants conferring risk of schizophrenia.$ Common variants in major histocompatibility complex region and TCF4 gene are significantly associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese$ Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder$ Schizophrenia susceptibility alleles are enriched for alleles that affect gene expression in adult human brain$ No significant association of 14 candidate genes with schizophrenia in a large European ancestry sample: implications for psychiatric genetics$ Rare structural variants disrupt multiple genes in neurodevelopmental pathways in schizophrenia$ Rare structural variants in schizophrenia: one disorder, multiple mutations; one mutation, multiple disorders$ Large recurrent microdeletions associated with schizophrenia$ Schizophrenia: a common disease caused by multiple rare alleles$ A framework for interpreting genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders$ The human genome browser at UCSC$ Cognitive and sensorimotor gating impairments in transgenic mice overexpressing the schizophrenia susceptibility gene Tcf4 in the brain",,6,27248931,TRNAV27

rs7453920,AA,,Good,,"rs7453920 adds an additional polymorphism to the growing body of literature supporting a genetic component to HBV infection and clearance. It is located in intron 1 of the HLA-DQB2 gene at the 6p21.32 locus. Therefore, the SNP does not affect the structure of the protein by any direct means. The A allele of this SNP has been associated with increased HLA-DQB2 mRNA levels in circulating monocytes (which are critical for mounting immune responses), increased HBV clearance, and CHB infection. $Alleles 1 and 2 at this location are A and G with G being the risk allele (p = 5.98E-28; OR = 1.81). $The HLA-DQB1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen) and HLA-DQB2 genes belongs to the HLA class II beta chain class paralogues. Class II molecules are heterodimers comprised of alpha (DQA) and beta (DQB) chains that are both anchored in the membrane. They play an integral role in the immune system and more specifically HBV clearance by presenting peptide sequences from extracellular proteins and are predominantly expressed in antigen-presenting cells such as B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Polymorphisms in the protein-coding portions of the genes for these heterodimers will result in the display of different kinds of peptides. The beta chain contains six exons and is approximately 26-28 kDa long. Exon 1 encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. rs7453920 is a mutation in the first intron of the gene and therefore does not directly affect the structure and function of the protein.$Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common cause of infectious liver disease, afflicting more than 400 million people worldwide. This chronic viral condition can be transmitted vertically during the neonatal period; horizontally during childhood via bites, lesions or sanitary habits; or during adulthood via sexual contact, drug use, or medical exposure. Though there are many factors that influence the expression of the disease including viral, host immunological, and environmental, there increasingly appears to be a strong genetic component to the body&#8217;s response to HBV.$Genes are impact five different pathways that affect the infection and clearance of HBV. These include (1) viral entry into the cells, (2) the immune response to HBV infection, (3) pathological alterations in liver tissue, (4) liver cirrhosis and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma, and (5) resistance to antiviral therapies.  Mutations in HLA class I and II alleles, cytokine and chemokines, as well as mannose binding protein (MBP) have all demonstrated strong associations with HBV clearance. Specifically, mutations in the DRB1 gene are associated with self-limiting courses of acute HBV while DQA1 and DQB1 are linked to viral persistence. $The varying release of cytokines and chemokines impacts the host&#8217;s immunological response to HBV as well as viral persistence. Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is associated with non-cytotoxic antiviral mechanisms.  Polymorphisms in the promotor region of TNF-a are associated with HBV and HCV persistence.  Finally, mannose binding protein (MBP) is an opsonin that activates the classical complement pathway of innate immunity and phagocytosis. Mutations in several codons including 52, 54, and 57 have impaired the functionality of MBP and therefore the phagocytotic defenses against HBV. $Additionally, several studies have demonstrated genetically variable outcomes to HBV vaccine-induced immunity. Peak vaccine-induced anti-HBs level is directly related to antibody decay, risk of infection, and persistent carriage. Variation in the IFNG, MAPK8, AND IL10RA genes affect peak anti-HBs levels (p &#8804; 0.001). $Significant association between SNP and chronic hepatitis B in a Japanese population.

The P value is extremely significant at 5.47 × 10-134, considering the threshold for genome-wide significance. $NOTE: In previous edits of this page, it has been noted that the (A) allele of [[rs9272346]] is common in various human populations, and one could consider the (G) allele as protective. However, the authors of  seem to disagree. (Of course, other significant genetic and/or environmental factors could be protecting the multitude of individuals with AG). In several other lines of their table, the allele identified as the risk allele is _not_ the minor allele. The authors are aware of the conventions for ODs for risk vs. protection, stating that risk allele ODs will be normally 1-2 and protective ODS are between 0.5-1 (Supplement 1, page 3).

Therefore, individuals carrying all 10 possible risk variants (two copies of each of the five SNPs) were assigned a GRS of 5 and those carrying no risk variants a GRS of -5. A high GRS was defined as 3 or higher. Approximately 4% of the white cohort in ARIC was classified as high risk, and the hazard ratio for CHD after adjustment for traditional risk factors was a significant 1.57 (CI: 1.21-2.04; p<0.001).

Here we found three novel loci for nephrolithiasis: RGS14-SLC34A1-PFN3-F12 on 5q35.3 (rs11746443; P = 8.51×10−12, odds ratio (OR) = 1.19), INMT-FAM188B-AQP1 on 7p14.3 (rs1000597; P = 2.16×10−14, OR = 1.22), and DGKH on 13q14.1 (rs4142110; P = 4.62×10−9, OR = 1.14). Subsequent analyses in 21,842 Japanese subjects revealed the association of SNP rs11746443 with the reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 6.54×10−8), suggesting a crucial role for this variation in renal function.",,7,30937178,

rs7850258,AG,1,Good,Typical odds of developing primary hypothyroidism.,"rs7850258 is located on chromosome 9 and is 67 kb from the nearest gene, ''FOXE1''. ''FOXE1'', also known as thyroid transcription factor 2, is an intronless gene with a crucial role in thyroid morphogenesis. This SNP is associated with primary [[hypothyroidism]].  Primary hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid disorder, affecting 1-5% of the population, and is characterized by deficiencies of thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). $Using electronic medical record-linked DNA biobanks, a study with 1,317 cases and 5,053 controls of European American ancestry identified rs7850258 to have the strongest association with hypothyroidism. The odds ratio for the minor allele A was 0.74 (p-value = 3.96 x 10-9). This SNP was in strong pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2  > 0.98) with three other SNPs 58-71 kb from ''FOXE1'', [[rs965513]], [[rs925489]], and [[rs10759944]]. $This association was replicated in a GWAS of 3,736 cases and 35,546 controls with a similar odds ratio of 0.78 (95% confidence interval = 0.74-0.82) for the association of rs7850258 with hypothyroidism. All participants were customers of 23andMe, Inc and of mostly European ancestry. They also found five other variants significantly associated with hypothyroidism near ''FOXE1'' ([[rs925489]]), ''PTPN22'' ([[rs6679677]]), ''SH2B3'' ([[rs3184504]]), ''VAV3'' ([[rs4915077]]), and the HLA region ([[rs2517532]]). $ [[rs7850258]] was found to be associated with [[hypothyroidism]] based on a study by the eMERGE network in which electronic medical records were searched to find clinical associations associated with selected SNPs.",,9,100549013,
rs965513,AG,2,Bad,1.77x increased thyroid cancer risk,"[[rs965513]] is located at 9q22.23 approximately 57 kb from the [[FOXE1]] locus. The rs965513 SNP is associated with papillary and follicular [[thyroid cancer]]. The major allele is G and the minor is A. The risk allele is A. Each A at [[rs965513]] increased the odds of [[thyroid cancer]] by 1.75 times. $==Clinical Picture==$In a given year, roughly 5 in 100,000 males and 14 in 100,000 females will develop differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). It is the most common endocrine cancer and rates are steadily rising, though this is likely due to increased detection.$Significant risk factors for developing DTC include radiation exposure during childhood whether during treatment of childhood cancers or from environmental exposure, family history, occupational exposures, and possibly hepatitis-C related chronic hepatitis. $Thyroid cancer presents commonly as a palpable mass detected by exam or imaging studies. Occasionally, DTC presents with symptoms of hypo- or hyperthyroidism. At the time of detection, 80% of patients have nodal involvement; between 2-10% of patients have metastasis beyond the neck, usually to the lungs or bones.$A positive prognosis is favored by a young age of diagnosis, smaller tumor size, absence of soft tissue invasion and absence of distal metastasis. In general, the prognosis for DTC is good, and most individuals with DTC do not die of the disease.$Management of DTC nearly always involves thyroidectomy and when there is evidence of some nodal involvement, neck dissection of the central lymph nodes. Surgery is often followed with radioiodine therapy in patients with distant metastases, large primary tumors, lymph node metastases or other predictive factors for a high risk of recurrence.$Long term management includes thyroid stimulating hormone suppression therapy, monitoring of serum thyroglobulin and serial neck ultrasounds. Further investigation may take place as necessary.$==SNP Association==$In a case-control GWAS, Gudmundsson et al. (2009)  identified two SNPs&#8212;[[rs965513]] and [[rs944289]]&#8212;associated with DTC. The study population (recruited from the Icelandic Cancer Registry) consisted of 192 cases who were histopathologically diagnosed with DTC and genotyped and an additional 186 DTC cases whose genomes were imputed from the genotypes of relatives. There were 37,196 controls (recruited from participants in separate research at the institution). The study looked at 304,083 SNPs.$For the rs965513 SNP, the frequency of the risk allele [A] in cases is 0.490 compared to 0.352 in controls. The allelic odds ratio is 1.77 (95% CI, 1.57-2.00) with a p-value of 6.8 x 10-20. $Following the initial study, results were tested in a replication study with two populations: first, 342 cases and 384 controls from Columbus, Ohio; and second, 90 cases and 1,343 controls from Spain. The results from the initial study for rs965513 were replicated in both replication study groups.$Gudmundsson et al. computed the genotype specific frequencies and ORs. They estimated that 11% of individuals are homozygous AA at the rs965513 site and that this is associated with a 3.1-fold increased risk compared to non-carriers for developing DTC.$Takahashi et al. (2010)  followed to assess the association of rs965513 with radiation associated papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in a population of Belarusian patients with PTC and radiation exposure and age matched radiation exposed controls. They conducted a series of GWA studies, validation studies and meta-analyses and concluded that rs965513 is associated with radiation associated PTC (meta-analysis of all study groups, cases:660, controls:1268; mhp=4.8 x 10-12, OR=1.65 (1.43-1.91)). $Matuse et al. (2011)  looked at the association of rs965513 with PTC using TaqMan SNP assays in a Japanese population with no radiation exposure. The study included 479 cases and 2764 controls. They again found a significant association OR=1.69 (1.29-2.21 at p=1.27 x 10-4). Wang et al. (2013) similarly assessed the association between rs965513 and PTC in a Chinese Han population with 846 cases and 1006 controls. A selection of SNPs were genotyped and the association between rs965513 and PTC was found to be OR=1.53 with a false discovery rate corrected p=1.827 x 10-4.$A more recent study by Zhuang et al. (2014)  conducted a meta-analysis study with a total of 8,491 cases and 103,218 controls. This study pooled data from 13 case-control or family based studies. Consistent with the results of Gudmundsson et al., Zhuang et al. report an allelic OR of 1.74 (95% CI, 1,62-1.86) with p<10-5.$Zhuang et al. stratified their analysis by ethnicity to assess the potential for population stratification. In Asian populations, the OR associated with [A] allele is only 1.42 (95% CI, 1.12-1.81, p=0.004) compared with an OR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.69-1.91, p<10-5) in Caucasian population. Further studies need to be done to assess the risk associated with the rs965513 SNP in different ethnic populations.$==Proposed Mechanism==$[[rs965513]] is located in a linkage-disequilibrium block containing the XPA, FOXE1, C9orf156 and HEMGN genes. XPA is involved in excision repair, for example following adduct formation via the chemotherapeutic cisplatin. HEMGN is associated with erythroid development and regulation of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The function of C9orf156 is not clearly defined. Though it is possible that a mutation in XPA that impairs excision repair could potentially predispose an individual to developing DTC following DNA damage, FOXE1 seems the most likely to be associated with the development of thyroid cancer given its known role in thyroid development.$FOXE1 (TTF-2, FKHL15) is a thyroid specific forkhead transcription factor critical to thyroid gland differentiation and morphogenesis during development, and maintenance of differentiated state during adulthood. FOXE1 interacts with nucleosomes through its DNA binding domain and alters the chromatin structure to expose sites for other transcription factors. Mutations in the FOXE1 gene or changes in the expression pattern may lead to a loss of the stable differentiated state. Expression of FOXE1 has been shown to be abnormal in DTC . $Gudmundsson et al.(2009)  investigate the association between rs965513[A] and thyroid function by looking at values of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3 and T4. Each rs965513 [A] was associated with a 5.9% decrease in TSH (p=2.9 x 10-4), a 1.2% increase in T3 (p=3 x 10-3), and a 1.2% decrease in T4 (p=6.1 x 10-5). These result indicate that the rs965513[A] affects thyroid function. Given the proximity of rs965513 to FOXE1, FOXE1&#8217;s known role in thyroid development and function, rs965513 association with the disturbance of normal thyroid and DTC, it seems likely that some rs965513 tags some sort of disruption of normal FOXE1 function. When combined with another risk factor like radiation exposure, a dysfunctional FOXE1 may facilitate progression in to the malignant state.$Notably Landa et al. (2009)  identified rs1867277 as a causal SNP in the FOXE1 5&#8217;UTR region. RS1867277 is associated with increased recruitment of the USF1/USF2 transcription factors leading to increased transcription of FOXE1. However, Matsuse et al. (2011)  determined that evidence for linkage-disequilibrium between rs1867277 and rs965513 is poor (D&#8217;=0.23) and concluded that the two SNPs likely have different functional significance. $ Published 2015: Multiple functional variants in long-range enhancer elements contribute to the risk of SNP [[rs965513]] in thyroid cancer.  The [A] allele of SNP [[rs965513]] in 9q22 has been consistently shown to be highly associated with increased papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) risk with an odds ratio of ∼1.8 as determined by genome-wide association studies, yet the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. ... Our results suggest that multiple variants coinherited with the lead SNP and located in long-range enhancers are involved in the transcriptional regulation of FOXE1 and PTCSC2 expression. These results explain the mechanism by which the risk allele of [[rs965513]] predisposes to thyroid cancer. (Abstract)$==Additional References==$A [[genoset]], [[Gs137]], has also been created in SNPedia to represent the increased risk reported for carriers of both variants.$See also: [http://blog.23andme.com/2009/02/06/snpwatch-two-gene-variations-linked-to-thyroid-cancer/ 23andMe blog]",,9,100556109,

rs1800546,GG,0,Good,normal,"'''WARNING!''' The orientation of this SNP was flipped from being on the FWD strand in the human genome assembly [[GRCh37]] to being on the REV strand in assembly [[GRCh38]]; then in August 2015 an alert SNPedia user alerted us to the fact that it has somehow flipped back to being on the FWD strand in dbSNP again, whereas in 2017 and now (2018) it is back on the REV strand. This SNP is clearly prone to confusion.$23andMe has a second SNP (in addition to [[rs1800546]]) assaying this position, which is identified as [[i5012663]].$[[rs1800546]] is located on chromosome 9q31.1 within the aldolase B fructose bisphosphate [[ALDOB]] gene.  rs1800546 is linked to approximately 65% of [[hereditary fructosuria]] (also known as fructose intolerance or HFI) cases in those of European ancestry.  The incidence of HFI in those of European ancestry is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 births.  HFI is an autosomal recessive condition.  This SNP is an [[ambiguous flip]] prone to some confusion (see warning at top of page), but to be clear, in SNPedia the current [[orientation]] for the ancestral allele of this SNP is now G, while the risk-associated allele is C. [Note: Reports from DNA testing labs may be not be clear which strand is being reported.] Aldolase B is a critical enzyme involved in the breakdown of the sugar fructose through the glycolysis pathway.  The nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution at position 149 from alanine to proline (A149P).$==CLINICAL OVERVIEW:==$Aldolase B fructose bisphosphate catalyzes the reversible reaction of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.  Further conversion of these 3-carbon products allows the byproducts of fructose metabolism to enter into the glycolysis pathway.  Homozygous loss of function of aldolase B leads to an inability of the body to break down fructose into byproducts for human consumption.  Due to the continuation of the first step in fructose breakdown, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, a phosphate sink is created in these patients, in which all the available phosphate is consumed in the cell.  This leads to the halt of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  Symptoms usually begin at the time of weaning and include: bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, mental depression, jaundice, and cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure and death.   Many patients display a food aversion to fructose-rich foods and practice strict avoidance of fructose-containing foods before their diagnosis.  The current gold standard for testing of fructose intolerance is the hydrogen breath test, in which the patient is administered fructose in the clinical setting, and hydrogen levels are measured before and at intervals after administration of the bolus of fructose.  An increase in hydrogen produced reflects the failure of the patient to absorb fructose, which is then metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal system to give off hydrogen.  The disadvantage of this test is that many patients respond to the fructose administration with signs of severe hypoglycemia including altered consciousness, diaphoresis, and seizures, sometimes resulting in death.  Therefore, elucidation of the causes of HFI and available genetic testing can avert the extreme clinical risks associated with standard of care diagnosis. $There is currently no cure for HFI, with the only treatment strict diet modifications to avoid fructose-containing foods.$==RISK-ASSOCIATED SNP:==$Numerous studies identify and characterize the deleterious nature of the A149P missense mutation, corresponding to rs1800546. $In 1988, Cross, et. al first described the genetic based for HFI in four patients as a G→C transversion in the coding sequence of exon 5 at position 149, resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine to proline in a critical substrate binding region.  PCR amplification revealed the A149P substitution in the proband and 4 members of the pedigree, showing the carrier status of the parents and one sibling, and the affected proband and another sibling,  $A case study of seven unrelated Italian patients with HFI was conducted in 2004 looking at the mutational spectrum within the aldolase B gene.  The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to perform sequencing of patient DNA for known and novel mutations in the aldolase B gene.  The nine exons, splice junctions, and promoter region were sequenced in each patient. In contrast to American mutations, in which the two most common mutations A149P and A175D account for 85-90% of phenotypes, they account for only 65% of patients in Italians, with many more rare mutations accounting for the remainder of the genetic basis underlying HFI.  $In 2005, the structures of the wild type and mutant aldolase B were published by Malay, et. al., revealing a thermolabile mutant.  The A149P mutant is reported to lose catalytic function at temperatures > 15°C, to lose tertiary structure at 33°C, and to lose its secondary structure at 45°C.  The structural constraints placed by the mutant amino acid proline disrupt the secondary structure of the β-sheet, with further reaching implications for the nearby catalytic site, including the neighboring arginine at position 148 and its interactions with Glu189 and Arg303.  The mutant structure was found to have only low levels of catalytic activity in vivo, with a T1/2 of 25°C, corresponding to almost no activity at body temperature of 37°C.  $In 2008, Davit-Spraul, et. al screened the molecular basis of HFI in 160 patients from 92 families by PCR-restriction.  Patients for which mutations could not be found were further investigated using exon scanning and LR-PCR to search for novel mutations and deletions or insertions.  In 75% of patients, the three most common mutations, including A149P, were identified.  15% of patients were found to have one A149P mutation with a rare or novel compound heterozygous mutation elsewhere in the aldolase B sequence.  $Other Selected References:$Wenzel, J.

It is located on chromosome 10p14, 7.2kb upstream of GATA binding protein 3 (''GATA3''), in the promoter region of the gene  $rs4143094 was identified in a screen of 2.7 million SNPs for the risk of [[colorectal cancer]], by combining 10 studies comparing 9287 cases and 9117 controls. Data was obtained from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and analyzed by conventional case-control logistic regression for multiplicative interactions between SNPs and dietary factors. $rs4143094 was the most significantly implicated SNP in 10p14 for processed meat consumption linked with occurrence of [[colorectal cancer]]. The risk allele (T) has an ORinteraction=1.17, p=8.73E-09 with evidenced heterogenetity by p=0.78. When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; [[rs1269486]], risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.$[[Colorectal cancer]] is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . $DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.$[[rs4143094]] on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of [[GATA3]] gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. $A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. $The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, [[rs1269486]], is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. $Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.",,10,8089136,GATA3

They are rare in women under 20, and often shrink and cause no symptoms in women who have gone through menopause. They are more common in African Americans than Caucasians.  The cause of uterine fibroid tumors is unknown. However, fibroid growth seems to depend on the hormone estrogen.

An initial GWAS (1031 cases of severe acne and 1031 selected control subjects without acne) identified 101 SNPs with evidence of association (P<1x10^-4 or P<1x10^-2 located within/near nine candidate susceptibility genes) including rs747650 (p = 8.12x10^-5, OR 95% CI 1.14-1.47). These SNPs were further evaluated in an independent cohort (1860 cases and 3660 controls). The replication round identified 3 SNPs achieving genome-wide significance including rs747650 (p = 9.25x10^-6, OR 95% CI 1.12-1.33) with an overall combined P=4.41x10^-9 / OR 95% CI 1.16-1.34.

The minor allele (i.e. A1, [[rs1800497]](T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain , and it has been postulated to play a role in [[alcoholism]], [[smoking]], and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.$The reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an understimulated state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs). It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.$A wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking [[rs1800497]] to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of [[rs1800497]] with such phenomena was statistically weak.  This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.$More recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug [[bupropion]] determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05).

The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with [[colorectal cancer]]) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.$A 2014 preliminary study links an individual's [[ANKK1]] [[rs1800497]] genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence.

rs34637584,GG,0,Good,normal,"First discovered in 2004, [[rs34637584]] is a SNP indicating a position within the [[LRRK2]] that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the [[G2019S]] variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.$Note: as of June 2016, we have noticed that this SNP is prone to being miscalled in AncestryDNA V2.0 datasets.$One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for [[Parkinson's disease]]. It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without [[Parkinson's disease]], and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one's risk for [[Parkinson's disease]], [[rs34637584]] is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Overall, the risk of [[Parkinson's disease]] for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium.$This SNP  has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian (<1%), European (1%&#8211;7%), North American (1%&#8211;3%), North African (34-41%), and Ashkenazi (10&#8211;25%) sporadic and familial [[Parkinson's disease]] patient populations .$The G2019S mutation is also common not only in Parkinson's disease patients but also in controls at a frequency of 2.2% in North African Berber-Arabs (13/597, ), 1.4% in Sephardic Jews (5/361, ) and 1.3% in Ashkenazic Jews (4/317, ) while it is found at a very low frequency of 0.06% in Europeans (1/1550, ) and not found in sub-Saharan Africans.$Individuals with G2019S who share the most common haplotype (mainly Europeans, Jews and North-Africans) very likely share a common ancestor estimated to have lived 1,525&#8211;1,830 years ago between the second and fifth centuries A.D. either in the Middle East  or in  North Africa . In contrast, other authors hypothesized that LRRK2 G2019S might be of Phoenician origin, rather than Arabic-Berber or Jewish, dating from the founding of ancient Carthage in 814 B.C. . G2019S has been observed on two additional background haplotypes (one in European&#8211;Americans and one in Japanese) distinct from the main one observed in Europeans, North-Africans and Jews. This suggests that G2019S has arisen independently on at least three separate occasions. According to the most extensive and thorough study by Lesage et al. in 2010, estimations indicated that the LRRK2 mutation on the main haplotype initially arose among Near-Easterners at least 4,000 years ago, much earlier than in previous estimations. Because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. The mutation might then have been reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario$Is a carrier of at least one rs34637584(A) allele definitely going to develop [[Parkinson's disease]] if they live long enough? No. Several studies have found that overall the odds of developing the disease for G2019S carriers depends on age, family history, and ethnicity. The odds for G2019S carriers were calculated to be 15% at 60 years, 21% at 70 years, and 32% at 80 years in a study of Italian patients , whereas in a Jewish population the age-specific odds were 24% at age 80.$Having a family history of [[Parkinson's disease]] in addition to carrying a rs34637584(A) allele is also associated with increased risk for the disease.$Do the odds differ between carriers of one and two rs34637584(A) alleles? Apparently not; a study of North Africans - one of the few populations likely to have sufficient numbers of homozygote rs34637584(A;A) individuals to study due to the rarity of the mutation - there was no clinical difference between [[Parkinson's disease]] patients carrying one or two copies, and, 3 individuals (ranging from 42-70 years old) who were rs34637584(A;A) and yet did not have the disease were also observed.$In 2019, a study concluded that compared to Parkinson patients due to other causes, G2019S-associated Parkinson patients had a ~10-fold higher chance of developing leukemia and a 2-fold higher chance of developing colon cancer, perhaps thereby meriting additional screening for those conditions. However, it was not clear if higher odds would have been seen in G2019S-carriers compared to healthy individuals not carrying the G2019S mutation.$This SNP was in the news [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/technology/19google.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin] in 2008 as one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, announced that he and his mother (who has Parkinson's disease) both carry the G2019S SNP. Mr. Brin was 35 years old at the time of the announcement, and in his [http://too.blogspot.com/ blog], he comments that I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds, which he states are somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure.$[http://www.helixgene.com/press/g2019s Helixgene] discusses this [http://www.helixgene.com/press/extended-g2019s extensively] and concludes that people with G2019S have about a 25% chance of [[Parkinson's disease]] in their lifetime.

rs10859871,AA,0,Good,common/normal,"==='''Summary of trait'''=== $[[Endometriosis]] is a disorder in which the endometrium, which lines the inside of a woman’s uterus grows outside the uterus (etopic). It affects 6% - 10% of women of reproductive age. In a patient with endometriosis, the endometrial tissue behaves normally, whereby during a menstrual cycle, it would thicken, break down and bleed out. Being outside the uterus, the broken down endometrial tissue cannot leave the body. This blood will irritate surrounding tissue, causing scar tissue and adhesions and may potentially bind organs together. Endometriosis may involve ovaries, bowel or tissue lining pelvis. Cysts (or endometriomas) may form if endometriosis involves ovaries . The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but the most widely accepted theory is the retrograde menstruation theory, proposed by Sampson in the 1920s . This theory is able to explain the presence of endometrial fragments in the peritoneal cavity.$Symptoms of endometriosis include dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps, whereby it is typically described as more painful that the usual menstrual pain. Other symptoms include painful intercourse, painful bowel movements or urination during periods, heavy periods or infertility. There is evidence suggesting that endometriosis could be genetically linked .$==='''Summary of Studies'''=== $Through a genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analysis of 4604 endometriosis cases and 9393 controls, involving both Japanese and Europeans (Australians and British), Nyholt et al identified SNP rs10859871 to be significantly associated with endometriosis in 2012 .  This is the first time rs10859871 has been identified to be associated with endometriosis, along with 6 other SNPs. rs10859871 is at 12q22, 17kb upstream of the vezatin (VEZT) gene. In their studies, the authors combined data from United Kingdom, Australia and Japan for meta-analysis to identify SNPs that are associated with endometriosis and is consistent between Europeans and Japanese. GWAS meta-analysis identified rs10859871 as one of the SNPs that achieved genome wide significance and is associated with endometriosis in both European and Japanese populations, with a P value of 5.5 × 10−9 and a p value of 3.7 × 10−7 for a more severe stage of endometriosis. The risk allele is C with an odds ratio of 1.18 (95% confidence interval = 1.12–1.25) . $In a separate study conducted by Pagliardini et al, the authors came to the same conclusion that the SNP at rs10859871 was significantly associated with endometriosis. In their study the authors used laparoscopy to identify 305 cases and 285 controls, and also included 2425 blood donor healthy controls. All subjects are of Italian heritage . Here, the authors reported the odds ratio when compared to the blood donor healthy controls to be 1.43, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.20 – 1.71 and P = 6.9 × 10−5 and odds ratio when compared to laparoscopic controls to be 1.53, 95% confidence interval of 1.24–2.02 and P = 2.1 × 10−4. When they combined their data with the data obtained by Rahmioglu et al, an odds ratio of 1.19 was obtained, with P = 7.9 × 10−20.), with C being the risk allele.$Data obtained by both authors are consistent with each other, in that when compared to healthy controls, the odds ratio is approximately 1.18. This odds ratio is further confirmed by GWAS studies by other authors . $==='''What’s known about the SNP'''=== $SNP rs10859871 is located near [[VEZT]] (vezatin). $VEZT encodes transmembrane protein vezatin, which forms part of the E-cadherin-catenin complex at adherens junctions and is also expressed in the actin cytoskeleton in most epithelial cells. When there is a loss of function in mouse embryos, the resulting loss or instability of actin cytoskeleton adherens junctions caused implantation failure and embryo death, suggesting the need for vezatin during implantation and embryogenesis  . $VEZT has been postulated to be involved in endometriosis based on the hypothesis that alterations in the expression of adhesion molecules have been observed in eutopic and ectopic cells from endometriosis patients. Therefore, VEZT is associated to endometriosis based on the fact that cell adhesion and migration is observed in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . $Based on a study in gastric cancer patients, it has been hypothesize that VEZT also plays a role in lymphatic metastasis and cancer invasion .$==='''Considerations for diagnosis/ treatment'''=== $Endometriosis has been associated with many other SNPs (e.g. [[rs10965235]], [[rs12700667]], [[rs7521902]] etc), in addition to rs10859871 and the odds ratio for the risk allele in all these SNPs are all less than 2 (relatively small odds). Consolidating GWAS data obtained by research groups in different countries, heterogeneity in genome wide significant SNPs are observed . For instance, rs10965235 achieved genome wide significance in Uno et al’s paper using a Japanese population (OR = 1.44, P = 5.57 × 10-12) [8] but could not be replicated by Painter et al using European data sets    , nor another study using a much smaller Japanese population  . $Therefore, the presence of the risk allele '''should not''' affect diagnosis/ treatment significantly.",,12,95711876,

[PMID 511165, PMID 16046871] $[[Disulfiram]] (Antabuse) is probably an ineffective treatment for [[alcohol dependence]] in people who have the Asian Flush. $Tests for the alcohol flush reaction at [[deCODEme]] are based on [[rs671]].$[http://blog.23andme.com/2009/03/24/researchers-warn-that-physicians-need-to-ask-about-alcohol-%E2%80%9Cflushing%E2%80%9D-to-reduce-esophageal-cancer-risk/ 23andMe blog] carriers of the A allele are prone to [[esophageal cancer]], which is also known as upper aerodigestive tract (UAT) [[cancer]], due to acetaldehyde from [[smoking]].$[[Alcohol Consumption, Smoking and Risk of Esophageal Cancer]]","Two working copies of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH2) mean you won't turn bright red when you drink alcohol, unlike most Asians. After your body turns alcohol into the dangerous acetaldehyde, this gene quickly turns the acetaldehyde into vinegar. It also stops the acetaldehyde in cigarettes from causing Esophageal Cancer. It reduces hangovers compared to Asians, but less hangovers and flushing obviously increases the risk of alcoholism. Alcoholism can be treated effectively with the drug Disulfiram (Antabuse) which would stop this gene from working and cause the Asian flush in non-Asians.$PMC2659709 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2659709/]AALDH2-deficient individuals are at much higher risk of esophageal cancer (specifically squamous cell carcinoma) from alcohol consumption than individuals with fully active ALDH2.

rs7294919,TT,0,,Average hippocampal volume,"[[rs7294919]], showed a particularly strong link to a reduced hippocampus volume, suggesting that this gene is very important to hippocampus development or health. No associations for brain volume, but they did discover that intracranial volume was significantly associated with two loci: [[rs4273712]], a known height locus on chromosome 6q22, and [[rs9915547]], tagging the inversion on chromosome 17q21. The SNP is located between two genes, [[HRK]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8739] and [[FBXW8]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26259], but evidence suggests that it influences the expression level of a gene 3&#8217; to [[FBXW8]], [[TESC]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54997]. Each copy of the T allele was associated with a 107.8 mm<sup>3</sup> decrease in hippocampal volume [http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2237.html]. In European populations, the effect allele (T) is found at frequency of 0.898 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7294919]. The minor allele (C) is found at a frequency of 0.102.$==Background==$The hippocampus is a critical brain structure involved in learning and memory. In particular, it is associated with the ability to form long-term memories of facts and events [http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v13/n4/full/nrn3200.html]. This is in contrast to short-term and working memory, which have been shown to be independent of the hippocampus [http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/1/15.long]. Hippocampal size decreases with age and is diminished in several disorders including Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12453673?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg], Major Depressive Disorder [http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v91/n2/full/clpt2011285a.html], Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774209890053], and Schizophrenia [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9596046.1]. Moreover, the size of the structure is heritable, with estimates of heritability ranging from 40-70% [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074774209890053][http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.20398/full].$==Studies==$Two major studies were conducted which found an association between rs7294919 and hippocampal volume. They were published in the April 15th, 2012 issue of <em>Nature Genetics</em> [http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2237.html][http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2250.html]. Though the P-values and regression slopes differ, both studies, together comprising tens of thousands of individuals, agree that the T allele is negatively associated with hippocampal volume.$#<p>The first study uses the CHARGE consortium (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) as its discovery cohort [http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2237.html]. CHARGE comprises 8 sub-cohorts representing 9,232 people with an average age of 67.1 years. Most of the sub-cohorts were from Europe and hippocampal volume was determined using MRI. Second stage verification/replication was performed on two cohorts comprising 2,318 subjects. This study found that rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume with a meta-P value (combining the discovery and replication cohorts) of 2.9 x 10<sup>-11</sup> and a regression slope (&#946;) of -107.8 mm<sup>3</sup> hippocampal volume.</p> <p>The authors provide some speculation about the SNP&#8217;s mechanism of action by reviewing the neighboring two genes. HRK is involved in apoptosis of neurons and is thought to play a role in ischemia-induced apoptosis. FBXW8 targets an E3 ubiquitin ligase to protein aggregates and has been shown to be involved in hippocampal neuron dendrite growth. Potential pitfalls of this study include the older age of the participants, the mixture of both computerized and manual hippocampus tracing in MRIs, and the predominantly European ethnic makeup of the cohorts.</p>$#<p>The second study&#8217;s discovery cohort comprised 17 European-ancestry cohorts representing 5,775 healthy people with a mean age of 34.8 years [http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2250.html]. An additional 2,020 people with various neuropsychiatric disorders were also included to determine whether the SNPs had disease-specific effects. To verify/replicate their findings, they used several cohorts comprising both European ancestry and non-European populations (Yoruba and Los Angeles Mexican).</p> <p>The study found that rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume with a combined P value of 1.99 x 10<sup>-7</sup> with a regression slope of -42.74 mm<sup>3</sup>. The authors also examined the association of the SNP with IQ. While no association was found with full-scale IQ, a small association was found between having the C (minor) allele and an increase in verbal IQ (P = 0.043, &#946; = 0.126). Using data from existing databases [http://compute1.lsrc.duke.edu/softwares/SNPExpress/index.php], rs7294919 (really rs4767492, a SNP used to impute rs7294919) was associated with expression of tescalin ([[TESC]])[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54997], a gene which lies 3&#8217; to FBXW8 in the brain. The T allele (associated with lower hippocampal volume) was associated with higher expression levels of TESC. TESC itself is expressed during brain development and is thought to regulate differentiation and proliferation. However, it is still not clear how increased TESC levels could be responsible for a decrease in hippocampal volume without additional studies.$==References/Links==$*http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120415151347.htm$*http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.2237.html$*http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.2250.html$*http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.2245.html",,12,117327592,

This specific aspect of hip shape correlates with OA characteristics only in carriers of the susceptibility allele. (Abstract)$ The -258A/G (SNP [[rs12885300]]) polymorphism of the human type 2 deiodinase gene is associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion of thyroid hormones following a TRH-induced acute rise in TSH.$. After thyroidectomy, high doses of L-T4 are used to suppress TSH. Since no T3 is being produced by the thyroid, the body depends on D1 and D2 enzymes to convert T4 into the active T3. This study collected 1905 serum samples from 151 patients over 8.8 to 11.5 years and analyzed four SNPs:$*DIO1-[[rs11206244]] (D1-C785T)$*DIO1-[[rs12095080]] (D1-A1814G) $*DIO2-[[rs225014]] (D2-Thr92Ala)$*DIO2-[[rs12885300]] (D2-ORFa-Gly3Asp). $Their data suggest that the negative feedback of FT(4) on TSH is weaker in patients homozygous for the D2-[[rs12885300]] T allele than in wild-type and heterozygous subjects. These patients have an altered set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. However, they noted that their data depended on TSH and T4 levels alone, since T3 and rT3 were measured at only one time point during the study.$ A common variation in deiodinase 1 gene DIO1 is associated with the relative levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine.

Medical conditions that may be linked to the rarer (minor) [[rs2494732]](C) allele include drug response, [[schizophrenia]], and drug-related psychoses, in particular, [[cannabis]]-related psychosis. $ A study of 442 healthy, once-a-month cannabis users between the ages of 16-23 to see if [[AKT1]] variants influenced acute psychosis response concluded that the number of [[rs2494732]](C) alleles predicted (p = 0.015) acute (i.e. temporary) psychotic response to [[cannabis]]. Basically, the more copies someone had of this SNP, the more likely they were to have mind-altering symptoms while stoned. Other factors studied, including gender, ethnicity, and years of cannabis use, did not predict whether they would have these (transient) symptoms. Note that this side-effect (psychosis or paranoia) was infrequent in an absolute sense regardless of genotype.$ A case-control study of 489 first-episode psychosis patients concluded that while [[rs2494732]] was not associated with an increased risk of a psychotic disorder, with lifetime cannabis use, or with frequency of use, there was a significant association between psychosis and cannabis use. [[rs2494732]](C;C) individuals with a history of cannabis use had an increased likelihood of a psychotic disorder (odds ratio 2.18, CI: 1.1 - 4.3) when compared with users who were (T;T) carriers.

rs2073711,CT,2,Good,Back Pain: lower risk of Lumbar Disc Disease.,"The [[rs2073711]] SNP (1184T&#8594;C ) is located in exon 8 of the cartilage intermediate layer protein gene (CILP). However, CILP gene is primarily known to be expressed abundantly in intervertebral discs, and was reported to have increased expression when degeneration occurs . For the [[rs2073711]] SNP, the ancestral allele is T and the disease associated risk allele is C. A study of Asian patients with [[lumbar disc disease]] (LDD) implicates each copy of a (C) allele of SNP [[rs2073711]] (as oriented with respect to dbSNP) as increasing risk about 1.6 fold. $==Background==$Low back pain (LBP) is an enervating condition that affects 70-85% of all people during their lifetime . It can lead to decreased physical activity and quality of life, presenting considerable negative socioeconomic and health impacts on many levels. Various studies have shown that although LBP is attributed to many factors, lumbar disc degeneration is a strong contributing factor especially among young individuals . $Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is one of the leading causes of disability in the working-age population. Numerous studies have been conducted to understand the causes of lumbar disc degeneration. Although the etiology of the LDD is not fully understood, it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors are involved in development of the disease, and that genetic factors play a more prominent role than environmental factors . Indeed, LDD shows strong familial predisposition, and identical twins exhibit similar degeneration on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies as well . Recent genetic studies reported association of several genes with LDD, supporting the idea that genetic factors are important in the etiology of LDD. $==Studies==$In 2005 Seki et. al, used a candidate gene case-control association study of Japanese individuals with symptomatic disc disease (N=467) and controls (N=654) . The intervertebral disc contains abundant extracellular matrix proteins that play crucial roles in homeostasis. The researchers selected 30 sequences variations in 20 such genes that encode matrix proteins in intervertebral disc. $[[rs2073711]] showed significant association with LDD ((OR 1.61, [CI 1.31 -1.98], p = 0.00020) . The [[rs2073711]] SNP (1184T&#8594;C ) is located in exon 8 of the cartilage intermediate layer protein gene (CILP), which is expressed abundantly in intervertebral discs, and was reported to have increased expression when degeneration occurs . For the [[rs2073711]] SNP, the ancestral allele is T and the disease associated risk allele is C. The allelic change results in a substitution of amino acid Ile395Thr. CILP proteins interact directly with TGF- &#946;1 mediated extracellular matrix protein synthesis and functional analysis showed that the C allele was associated with increased binding and inhibition of TGF- &#946;1, suggesting that regulation of TGF- &#946;1 signaling by CILP might have an important role in symptomatic disc disease. $However, in 2007, another group failed to identify any relationship between the CILP 1184T/C allele and LDD in Finnish and Chinese subjects. They made the argument that if the association between the CILP 1184T/C and LDD exists, the same association would be replicable in distinct populations.  They included Finnish subjects (case =243, control 259) with symptoms of LDD and Chinese individuals with MRI-defined LDD only (case = 348, control = 343) and analyzed the [[rs2073711]] SNP as well as flanking SNPs. Their results showed that the CILP 1184T/C allele was not a major risk factor for symptoms of LDD in Finnish subjects (OR =1.35, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.87; P=0.14) or in the Chinese $population (OR=1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.43; P=0.71) . $This study shows no evidence of association of CILP and LDD in both Finnish and Chinese population, suggesting that cartilage intermediate layer protein gene is not a risk factor for symptoms of LDD in general population. As a result, this contradictory study compelled researchers to conduct more detailed investigation on the association of CILP and LDD, especially in different ethnic populations. $A later study in 2009 on lumbar disc degeneration in Japanese collegiate judo athletes revealed that there is a significant association of the 1184T/C SNP variant at the CILP gene. The study involved 89 Japanese judo athletes, and they used MRI to define LDD and DNA sequencing to perform genotyping of the 1184T/C SNP. They calculated the odds ratio of lumbar disc degeneration with the CILP to be 2.4, with 95% confidence interval of 1.13-5.11 and p-value of 0.02, which indicates the significant risk factor of CILP for lumbar disc degeneration occurrence in Japanese collegiate judo athletes . $Another study of intervertebral disc degeneration among young Finnish adults was undertaken to assess the association between relevant candidate gene polymorphisms and moderate LDD. They investigated the associations of 19 SNPs in 16 genes with LDD among 538 young adults (46% control, 54% case). The risk of LDD was significantly higher in subjects with an allele G in IL6 SNPs [[rs1800795]] (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96, p-value 0.042) and [[rs1800797]] (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.85, p-value 0.074). There is also association between LDD and SKT [[rs16924573]] (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07-0.96, p-value 0.023) and CILP [[rs2073711]] in woman only (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.07-3.89, p-value 0.025) . $The most recent study (2012) searching for susceptibility genes in LDD validated some association of SNPs and LDD by examining both Finnish and Danish young individual populations  (Eskola, 2012).  The study showed that among Finnish individuals, polymorphisms in IL6 (G-allele OR 1.45, [95% CI 1.07&#8211;1.96], p=0.042), SKT (OR 0.27 [95% CI 0.07&#8211;0.96], p=0.024) and CILP (only in women: CC/TT vs. CC genotype OR 2.04 [CI 1.07&#8211;3.89], and p=0.025) were associated with moderate LDD, but the association in CILP was significant only in woman. The results support most of earlier findings on genes in LDD association studies; however, there are unexpected differences between genders observed .$==Summary==$The results emphasize the complexity and some conditional specificity of LDD development, and the important role of further study in populations with different ethnic, age, and especially on gender specificity backgrounds. A thorough understanding of the contribution of variation is valuable, and this genetic information could be used to help patients predict their risks of developing LDD throughout their lifetime based on their variation in the genomes. Overall, SNP [[rs2073711]] has shown some level of association with LDD especially in women populations and Japanese population, and functional analysis of related cartilage intermediate layer protein gene also provides some evidence of its potential role in LDD development. Further studies should be conducted to verify the association in distinct populations with different backgrounds.$==References==$ Battie, M.C.et al.

This form of glaucoma causes up to 10% of the cases of blindness in many countries, including the US.  From the abstract of this study: Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype [C;C here combined with other risk SNPs] and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes.$The risk allele for this SNP is [[rs3825942]](C), as oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry, and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 27 compared to the (T) allele.

It is characterized by disordered muscular behavior (e.g., hypotonia, hyperextension) and neurological symptoms, such as blindness, developmental and cognitive delays. The neurological findings appear to be due to demyelination and leukodystrophy.

Ultimately, sufferers become extremely ill and die on average at 18 months of age.$[[rs28940279]] is a SNP in the aspartoacylase [[ASPA]] gene.   The A-C transversion results in a substitution of alanine, a hydrophobic small-chain amino acid, for a glutamate (which is both large and charged). This substitution, E285A, is at a residue predicted to be part of the catalytic domain of aspartocyclase. This missense mutation is predicted to have drastic effects on the catalytic domain because of the vast difference between the amino acids.$In particular, this substitution is common in [[Ashkenazi Jews]], with carrier frequency approximately 1 in 60 individuals.

rs1050631,CT,2,Bad,Mean Survival Time of 25 months for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma,"[[rs1050631]] is a SNP on chromosome 18q12 in exon 6 of SLC39A6 gene, associated with length of survival in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma(ESCC). The SNP is located in the 5&#8217; UTR of SLC39A6.$In a study, a genome-wide scan of SNPs to identify variants associated with length of survival in 1331 individuals with ESCC was performed, and was validated by two independent sets, including 1962 individuals with ESCC (1308 and 654 individuals in two different replications).  The hazard ratio for death (odds ratio)  (T; T) and (C; T) from ESCC in the 1331 test cases was 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17&#8722;1.53; P = 7.78 E-6). For the combined data, hazard ratio of death similarly was found to be 1.34 (95% CI = 1.17&#8722;1.53; P = 7.78 E&#8722;6). The combined discovery and replication sets for analysis showed that the Mean Survival Times (MSTs) for individuals with the TT or CT genotype at rs1050631 were 17 and 25 months, respectively, substantially less than the 32 months seen for individuals with the CC genotype.$When a fine mapping of a 600-kb region of SLC39A6 centered on rs1050631 was performed, the study was able to test 866 SNPs and identified another 24 imputed SNPs in the SLC39A6 gene and its potential promoter region highly correlated with length of survival in person with ESCC. 7 of these SNPs, located in the 5&#8217; UTR were in high LD with the rs1050631 SNP, and it was also shown that these SNPs could be tagged by rs7242481. Since, both of these tagging SNPs &#8211; rs7242481 and rs7242481&#8212; showed relation to the mean survival time (MST) of ECSS patients, conditional study was performed to see the interdependence between the two SNPs. The result showed that after conditional analysis, both SNPs were no longer significant, indicating they are unlikely to represent independent signals. $rs7242481, located in the 5&#8242; UTR of SLC39A6, disturbs a transcriptional repressor binding site and results in upregulation of SLC39A6 expression.  An experiment was performed to verify overexpression of SLC39A6, in which of 76 primary ESCC tissues, 55 (72.4%) overexpressed SLC39A6 mRNA, with the mean expression level (&#177; s.e.m.) being significantly higher in ESCC tumors than in their corresponding adjacent normal tissues (0.01403 &#177; 0.0023 versus 0.0062 &#177; 0.0008; P = 0.0022). The study showed that a G>A transition at rs724248, which is located in the 5&#8242;&#61472;UTR of the gene, causes increased, constitutive expression of SLC39A6, probably owing to the disturbance of a transcriptional repressor binding site, suggesting the functional relevance of this site.$The C>T transition at rs1050631 showed synonymous change located in exon 6 of SLC39A6. However, further studies are warranted to elucidate whether the C>T change at rs1050631 affects SLC39A6 function.

rs4804803,AG,,,,"The SNP [[rs4804803]] is a variant (-336A>G) in the promoter region for the CD209 gene that results in altered CD209 transcription. It is associated with modified resistance to several infectious diseases, including viruses (Hepatitis C, HIV, dengue, SARS), and bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), as well as other disorders of varying etiology (ulcerative colitis). The CD209 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. The protein product of CD209, DC-SIGN, plays an important role within both the innate and adaptive immune systems. $DC-SIGN's role differs depending on which cell type it resides. On macrophages, DC-SIGN is responsible for recognizing and binding to mannose-type carbohydrates, which are found in almost all pathogenic organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.) but not human cells; this binding induces phagocytosis of the offending pathogen by the macrophage . On dendritic cells, DC-SIGN binds the ICAM-3 molecule on naive T-cells with high affinity, mediating the initial interaction of T-cells with dendritic cells that is responsible for initiating the adaptive immune response . However, pathogens can also exploit this T-cell adhesion for their own purposes (see sections on HIV and Hepatitis C virus). $== Mechanism of Action ==$The [[rs4804803]] SNP is located in the promoter region of CD209, 212 base pairs from the major transcription start site toward the 5' end of the gene . Variants at this location affect transcription factor binding sites for Sp1/GATA1/CACCC and Sp1/GATA1/CACAC-binding transcription factors of the type GGGTGGG; the G allele at position 5 (GGGTGGG) is associated with transcription factor binding, and the A allele (GGGTAGG) with its absence . The [[rs4804803]] SNP is empirically known to affect the binding of nuclear extract proteins to the promoter region of CD209 . Both electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and promoter activity assays have revealed that the presence of the A allele results in higher rates of CD209 transcription and the production of more DC-SIGN gene product. $== Associations with Disease == $'''Hepatitis C Virus'''$In one study of 131 Irish women who had received HCV-contaminated anti-D-immunoglobulin (resulting in chronic HCV infection) and 79 healthy controls, Ryan et al found no association between [[rs4804803]] genotype and the risk of HCV chronicity . However, of those women with chronic HCV infection, presence of at least one G-allele at position 366 was associated with more advanced liver disease. Specifically, patients with the AG or GG genotype had significantly worse liver fibrosis scores (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and higher alanine aminotransferase (biomarker for hepatocellular injury) levels (p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) than those with the AA genotype. This study tested only the [[rs4804803]] SNP, so p<0.05 was considered significant.  $The exact mechanism behind the HCV/DC-SIGN association is still unknown. However, DC-SIGN binds proteins on the surface of Hepatitis C virions (HCV), specifically the E1 and E2 viral glycoproteins . Capture of circulating Hepatitis C viral particles by DC-SIGN on cells within the liver may facilitate viral infection of nearby hepatocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations, which can lead to the establishment of chronic HCV infection and hepatocellular damage .$'''Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1'''$A study of HTLV-1 occurrence in four different Brazilian ethnic groups revealed that the -336A variant was more frequently-observed in HTLV-1-infected patients than in controls (OR = 2.511, p = 0.0197) . The study tested four CD209 variants (336A/G, 332A/G, 201T/G and 139A/G; significance threshold approximately p<0.0125); the protective effect of the [[rs4804803]] G-allele for HTLV-1 infection (the reverse of what is observed for HCV) should therefore be considered weak. These authors also observed that the -336G allele occurred with higher frequency among Afro-Brazilians (42.0%) and Caucasians (26.7%) than in Asians (5.4%), and was not observed at all in the Amerindian group. $'''Dengue Fever Virus'''$The G allele of the [[rs4804803]] SNP was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in three independent Thai cohorts . This study investigated the effects of 40 separate CD209 polymorphisms on dengue susceptibility (significance threshold approximately p=0.00125), and [[rs4804803]] was the only polymorphism that displayed a significant association. The carrier frequency of the G allele among individuals with dengue fever was 4.7%, compared to 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 19.5% in controls. This seems to indicate that the presence of the G allele at [[rs4804803]] provides dominant protection against dengue fever (OR for protection = 4.90, p = 2e-6), but not against dengue hemorrhagic fever. Among individuals with dengue, genotypes GG and GA increased the risk of contracting dengue hemorrhagic fever instead of dengue fever (OR = 5.84, p = 1.4e-7).$In another study that investigated only the [[rs4804803]] SNP (significance threshold p=0.05), investigators found that GG/AG genotypes at SNP [[rs4804803]] occurred at a significantly higher rate in dengue patients than in patients with non-dengue febrile illnesses (OR = 3.23, p = 0.002), and population controls (OR = 2.36, p = 0.020) . A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of [[rs4804803]] and the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever was found when compared to dengue fever, non-dengue febrile illness, and control patients (p = 0.004, 3e-5, 0.001 respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with non-dengue febrile illnesses and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020 respectively). In addition, dendritic cells from individuals from individuals with the AG genotype displayed higher levels of DC-SIGN expression and significantly higher expression of several important cytokines compared to those from AA individuals in response to dengue infection, but the viral replication in dendritic cells with the AG genotype was lower than those with the AA genotype . This study seemed to contradict the result from  that the G allele was protective against dengue; however, the authors mentioned that the definitions of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever used in the two studies were different; in addition, the latter study was conducted in Taiwan while the former was conducted in Thailand, and the frequency of the G allele differed significantly between the two study populations (3.8% in populations of Chinese descent; 9.5-10.4% in Thailand).$'''Mycobacterium Tuberculosis'''$One study that investigated the role of the [[rs4804803]] SNP (significance threshold p=0.05) on tuberculosis in a large cohort of individuals from sub-Saharan Africa found that the -336G allele provided significant overall protection against pulmonary tuberculosis (OR = 0.86, p = 0.006), and patients homozygous for the G allele had a decreased risk of tuberculosis-induced lung cavitation, a more severe form of TB (OR = 0.42, p = 0.00003) . $In a previous study of a South African cohort (8 SNPs investigated; significance threshold approximately p=0.00625), Barreiro and colleagues found that [[rs4804803]] genotypes GG and GA were more frequently observed in tuberculosis cases (70.6%) than controls (61.9%, p = 0.01). The presence of the G allele was therefore associated with an increased risk of developing TB . Because the A allele was mainly confined to Eurasian populations, the authors speculated that this variant may have increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of host genetic adaptation to a longer history of exposure to tuberculosis. $'''Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)'''$Using samples obtained from 1,611 European-American participants at risk for parenteral or mucosal HIV infection (5 SNPs investigated; significance threshold approximately p=0.01), Martin et al found that individuals at risk for parenterally-acquired infection who had the -336G polymorphism were more susceptible to infection than individuals with the -336A allele (odds ratio = 1.87, p = 0.001) . $The mechanism by which this variant may lead to differential HIV infection risk is unknown; however, it is known that the HIV virus attaches to dendritic cells via the binding of viral protein gp120 to DC-SIGN . By binding to DC-SIGN, the virus is engulfed into a mildly-acidic endosomal compartment within the cell, which protects it as the dendritic cell makes its way to lymphoid tissue and promotes trans-infection of T-cells .$'''SARS Coronavirus'''$DC-SIGN shares 77% amino acid similarity with CLEC4M, the usual binding receptor for the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) . It was found to interact with the spike protein of the virus, facilitating viral transmission to susceptible cells . $SARS patients with a -336G-positive genotype (either AG or GG) have a 2.5-fold greater chance of having lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared with -336AA patients (one SNP tested; significance threshold = 0.05; p = 0.014) . High LDH levels are known to be an independent predictor for poor SARS clinical outcome, possibly because of the increased tissue destruction that is the result of immune hyperactivity . Thus, SARS patients with the AA genotype have a 60% greater chance of a poor prognosis than GG or AG patients . $'''Inflammatory Bowel Diseases'''$The CD209 gene is located in a region previously linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease . One group found no initial association between the rs4804803 SNP and IBD, but upon stratification of ulcerative colitis patients by HLA-DR3 status (a strong protective allele), showed that carriage of the -366G allele increased susceptibility in the HLA-DR3-positive individuals (one SNP tested; significance threshold = 0.05; OR = 1.77, p = 0.03) relative to controls .$== Summary of Effects ==$Overall, the empirically-observed effects between the [[rs4804803]] SNP and risk for various diseases have been contradictory, even among studies of the same disease. For HCV, the presence of the G allele appears to cause a worse clinical outcome than the A allele , while for HTLV-1, the G allele is protective . For dengue, two separate studies yielded two different results: in a Thai cohort, the G allele was strongly protective , while for a Taiwanese cohort the A allele was protective . A similar contradiction was observed for tuberculosis, where one study observed that the G allele was protective  and another observed that it was destructive . So far, the G allele appears protective for SARS , but the A allele is protective for both HIV and inflammatory bowel diseases  . $Perhaps these contradictory results are due to the conflicting effects of DC-SIGN expression when an organism is confronted with different infectious organisms. The A allele at position 336 in CD209 is correlated with increased DC-SIGN expression in vitro, but it is unclear how this would manifest itself clinically. For example, increased DC-SIGN expression on dendritic cells could lead to a faster and stronger immune response to certain infections, but it could cause others (for example, viruses that can use DC-SIGN as an entry portal to host cells) to increase in severity. It is clear, however, that differences in expression of the CD209 gene product do lead to differential host response to infection; much of the variability among studies could be due to geographic/ethnic differences in study population, or different mechanisms of pathogenesis for the organisms involved. Clearly, further work is needed to firmly establish the clinical effects of this important SNP.$[[Tuberculosis Susceptibility]]",,19,7812733,CD209

rs12608932,AC,1.5,Bad,Slight (1.5x) increase in ALS risk,"rs12608932 is a SNP located in an intron of the UNC13A gene which encodes UNC13A, a protein involved with regulation of neurotransmitters like glutamate at central and neuromuscular synpases.  $Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly detected a significant but modest association between rs12608932(C) and risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with an odds ratio <1.30, but the SNP appears to convey a larger effect on survival in those who actually have ALS. Mean survival in rs12608932(C;C) ALS patients is 6 to 12 months shorter compared those carrying one or two (A) alleles. Approximately 16% of ALS patients are rs12608932(C;C), and a meta-analysis shows that, in contrast to C9orf72-associated ALS patients, treatment with lithium carbonate improved the 12-month survival from 40.1% (CI: 23.2–69.1) to 69.7% (CI: 50.4–96.3).$rs12608932(C, reference allele: A) was identified as a risk allele associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease in a two-stage association study with individuals of European ancestry. An initial genome-wide study (2,323 case and 9,013 control subjects) identified SNPs that exhibited P-values less than 1.0x10-4, including rs12608932 (P =1.30x10-9, OR=1.25).  These SNPs were further evaluated in a second, independent cohort of individuals (2,532 affected individuals and 5,940 controls). This SNP exhibited significant association in the replication round (P=1.86x10-6, OR=1.20 replication round) with an overall combined P=2.50x10-14. $	$Two replication studies examining the association of including rs12608932 did not identify any significant association with sALS. The first of these studies was performed with patients from France (285 cases and 285 controls) were genotyped for rs12608932 exhibited P=0.85.  The second examined two separate populations of Japanese (1179 cases/1645 controls) and Chinese (684 cases/830 controls) ancestry and found no significant association of rs12608932 with sALS (P=0.67 OR=1.02 for Japanese and P=0.73 OR=1.02 for Chinese).  Additionally, the allele frequencies differ between the Eastern Asian population (MAF in Japanese controls: 0.741, cases: 0.746; in Chinese controls: 0.675, cases: 0.681) and the European ancestry population in the initial GWA study that identified rs12608932 as associated with sALS. The minor allele frequency in this study was 0.395 in patients and 0.342 in controls in the first GWAS stage and 0.369 in patients and 0.337 in controls in the second-stage of the study.    In both the French and East Asian replication studies, the sample sizes may have been too small to exclude rs12608932(C) as a risk allele for sALS. For example, the power of the Chinese population study was only 63%.  $A more recent smaller-scale replication study did identify an association of rs12608932 with sALS in patients of Dutch ancestry (P=0.001). Additionally, the authors collected data on the survivability of patients with sALS and control individuals (of Dutch, Swedish, and Belgian descent) from the previous GWAS which initially associated rs12608932 with ALS . This study showed a weak association with survivability and rs12608932 (P<0.001) when fit to a recessive model. Patients homozygous for the minor allele of rs12608932 (CC) exhibited shorter survival after ALS onset than patients AC or AA by 5 and 10 months in the Dutch population and GWAS cohort, respectively.

rs1064395,GG,,Good,Normal risk of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia,"rs1064395 is a single nucleotide variant (SNV) found in the neurocan gene (NCAN) that has been implicated as a predictor of both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia. BD is characterized by a fluctuation between manic episodes and severe depression.  Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, both visual and auditory, paranoia, disorganized thinking and lack of normal social skills.  $NCAN is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is involved in cell adhesion and migration.  It contains 14 exons and spans 41 kb of the genome at the location 19p12. [OMIM] It has also been found that, in mice, this gene is expressed in a localized way in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain which are responsible for cognition and regulation of emotions. $In 2011, a study by Cichon et al identified rs1064395 in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Bipolar Disorder (BD).  This study was done by analyzing around 500,000 autosomal SNPs and 12,000 X-chromosomal SNPS in 682 patients with BD and 1300 controls. The patients studied were from Europe, the USA, and Australia.  The study then went forward to test the top 48 hits from their initial GWAS with an independent cohort of 1729 cases and 2313 controls, which narrowed down their significant hits to a list of eight.  These eight were then used in a meta analysis.  The rs1064395 was highly significant with a p-value of 3.02X10-8 and an odds ratio of 1.31, with A being the risk allele. The authors then further validated with a much larger sample size (6030 cases and 31,749 controls) and found a p-value of 2.74X10-4 and an odds ratio of 1.12 which, combined with their previous study lead to an overall p-value of 2.14X10-9 and an odds ratio of 1.17. $In 2012, a study by M&#252;hleisen et al investigated this same SNP in case control studies involving schizophrenic patients. They designed a patient-control study using samples from patients with European ancestry.  The initial study included a cohort of 5061 patients and 9655 controls.  The risk A-allele was found more frequently in schizophrenic patients then in controls with a p-value of 2.28X10 -8 and an odds ratio of 1.11.  They followed up this initial experiment using a independent cohort from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric GWAS Consortium that included 5537 patients and 8043 controls. This follow up inquiry yielded a p-value of 0.0239 and an odds ratio of 1.07.  Thus, these authors concluded that, not only is rs1064395 predictive of BD, it is also predictive of schizophrenia.

At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation . Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis . $The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry . This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.$The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients . This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.$An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry . This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations.",,20,44747947,CD40

rs6010620,GG,1.4,Bad,1.4x higher risk for glioma development; but this is the common allele. 1.4x higher risk for atopic dermatitis in Han Chinese,"'''rs6010620''' is a SNP associated with atopic dermatitis (AD).  Also known as eczema, AD is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders with a prevalence estimated up to 20% in children and 3% in adults .  It is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease that likely involves various genetic factors.  The SNP rs6010620 locates on chromosome 20q13.33, at which there are eight genes &#8212; ''PRIC285'', ''STMN3'', ''RTEL1'', ''TNFRSF6B'', ''ARFRP1'', ''ZGPAT'', and ''LIME1'' &#8212;, within a single 200-kb LD block around rs6010620.  Among them, ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' might be the susceptibility candidates whose expressions correlate with the SNP as suggested by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis .  $rs6010620&#8217;s association with AD was first identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) published in 2011, involving 491,905 autosomal SNPs in 1,012 cases and 1,362 controls from southern China followed by two replication studies &#8212; one with an additional 3,624 cases and 12,197 controls of Chinese Han ethnicity, the other had 1,806 cases and 3,256 controls from Germany .  rs6010620 showed evidence for AD association in both the combined Chinese population (minor/risk allele G; ''P'' = 3.00 &#215; 10-8; OR = 1.17) and in the German cohort (minor allele A; risk allele G; ''P'' = 2.87 &#215; 10-5; OR = 0.80).$The association was subsequently validated in a two-stage GWAS meta-analysis carried out later (''P'' = 0.002; OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.03&#8211;1.15) .  This GWAS involved 5,606 cases and 20,565 controls from 16 population-based cohorts of European descent in the discovery meta-analysis, and the ten most strongly associated new susceptibility loci were then examined in the replication meta-analysis encompassing an additional 5,419 affected individuals and 19,833 controls from 14 studies.$The group which published the first GWAS in 2011 recently validated the association as well with 4,538 cases and 13,412 controls from multiple cities in the central and northern parts of China (''P''GG = 1.83 &#215; 10-7; OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.23&#8211;1.58) .  rs6010620&#8217;s association with subphenotypes of AD was examined in this study, and the SNP showed significant protective effect for sporadic AD (''P''genotype = 0.01; ''P''Bonferroni = 0.006; OR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.43&#8211;0.83).  $Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6B (TNFRSF6B) is an immune receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing cell death .  It has been shown that mRNA expression of serum TNFRSF6B in AD patients are higher than those in healthy individuals and control subjects with non-atopic inflammatory diseases .  ''ZGPAT'', on the other hand, encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type with G patch domain-containing protein (ZIP) that transcriptionally represses several singling cascades including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway .  EGFR is overexpressed in skin lesions of AD patients and inhibition of its signaling induces dysregulated chemokine profiles that augment skin inflammation .  Taken together, these results indicate that ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' are indeed plausible causal genes for AD, while further fine mapping and functional studies are still needed before an unequivocal conclusion can be made on the exact susceptibility genes at 20q13.33 .$----$[http://blog.23andme.com/2009/07/06/snpwatch-genetic-variants-near-tumor-suppressor-genes-may-increase-risk-for-brain-and-skin-cancer/ 23andMe blog] [[rs6010620]] G 1.28 [[Glioma]]",,20,62309839,RTEL1-TNFRSF6B

The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below.$[http://blog.23andme.com/2009/07/31/dna-variation-may-help-us-break-free-from-our-routines/ 23andMe blog] summarizes the alleles at this SNP as$*[[rs4680]](A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions$*[[rs4680]](G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditions$Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at ) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.$Specific studies include:$[[rs4680]], a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial [[schizophrenia]].

The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli.$ Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states.$ In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes.

Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one or two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry. $Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of [[G6PD deficiency]], which is a disease affecting red blood cells. For example, an G to A substitution mutation at the rs1050828 (also referred to as G202A) is associated with a reduction of G6PD.  The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of the rs1050828 A allele ([[rs1050828(A;A)]]).  In addition, individuals who are type A- almost always possess the [[rs1050829]] G allele.
