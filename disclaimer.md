## Trait Odds Calculation Disclaimer

The odds ratios calculated in the trait report should be taken very lightly. *The tool is intended to be used to quickly find SNPs relevant to a given condition, rather than provide exact risk scores for said condition.* Risk scores are simply calculated as a product of odds ratios of SNPs that are often taken from multiple GWASs, which may use different methods of measurement. See the EBI GWAS pages for [response to venlafaxine](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/efotraits/EFO_0006328) or [eye color](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/efotraits/EFO_0003949) for examples of when this crude method of calculation breaks down.
